## Important Guidelines

**DO:**
- ✅ Ensure your resource genuinely fits their page's theme and quality level
- ✅ Compliment something specific on their existing list
- ✅ Emphasize the value to their audience (not just that you want a link)
- ✅ Make it easy to add: provide title, URL, and a suggested description
- ✅ Acknowledge they curate quality content ("great collection," "excellent resource")

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Pitch your homepage or a generic pillar page—pitch specific tools/assets
- ❌ Claim your resource is "better" than others on their list
- ❌ Demand inclusion ("you should add this")
- ❌ Send to resource pages that are clearly outdated or abandoned
- ❌ Follow up more than once—they're either interested or not

---

## Success Metrics

Track in your outreach spreadsheet:
- Resource pages identified
- Emails sent
- Response rate
- Inclusions achieved
- Average domain authority of successful targets

Expect a 15-25% response rate and 8-12% inclusion rate. Resource page curators are often receptive if your content is genuinely high-quality and relevant.

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Quality over quantity:** 10 links from DR 70+ resource pages >> 100 links from low-quality directories
2. **Wait for updates:** Some resource pages are updated quarterly or annually—timing matters
3. **Provide suggested copy:** Make it easy for them by drafting a 1-sentence description they can use
4. **Check their criteria:** Some resource pages state explicit inclusion criteria—follow them
5. **Don't pitch competitors:** If their resource page lists a competitor's tool doing the same thing, skip it

## Example: Pitching the Named Storm Deductible Calculator

**Target page:** "Florida Yacht Owner Resources" on a marina website

**Customized email:**

```
Subject: Resource suggestion for your Florida Yacht Owner page

Hi Sarah,

I was searching for Florida-specific yacht resources and found your
"Essential Resources for Florida Yacht Owners" page. This is a great
collection—I bookmarked the NOAA hurricane tracking link for the season.

I recently built a tool that might be a good fit for your list:

Named Storm Deductible Calculator
https://www.myyachtsinsurance.com/tools/named-storm-deductible-calculator

It's a free calculator that helps Florida yacht owners estimate their
exact named storm deductible before hurricane season. We've had positive
feedback from owners who used it to plan their cash reserves.

Key features:
- Calculates deductible based on insured value and policy percentage
- Shows total out-of-pocket exposure for partial vs total losses
- Includes planning tips for high-deductible scenarios

Would this be a fit for your resource page? Either way, thanks for
maintaining such a helpful collection for the Florida yachting community!

Best,
Alex
```

**Why this works:**
- Specific compliment about their existing list
- Clear value proposition tied to their audience (Florida yacht owners)
- Concrete outcome (plan cash reserves)
- Acknowledges it's their decision ("would this be a fit?")
- Under 150 words
