# Broken Link Replacement Email Template

**Purpose:** Inform site owners of broken outbound links and suggest your resource as a replacement.

**When to use:** When you find relevant yacht insurance articles linking to dead pages (404s, expired domains, removed content) and you have a high-quality alternative resource.

## Email Template

**Subject:** Broken link on your [PAGE_TITLE] page

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I was researching [TOPIC] and came across your article: [ARTICLE_URL]

Great piece! I especially appreciated [SPECIFIC COMPLIMENT].

I noticed one of your outbound links appears to be broken:

**Current link:** [BROKEN_URL]
**Error:** [404 / Domain expired / Page removed]

I recently published a comprehensive guide on this exact topic that might work as a replacement:
[YOUR_REPLACEMENT_URL]

It covers [KEY POINTS YOUR RESOURCE ADDRESSES] with examples and visual aids.

Would updating the link be helpful for your readers? Happy to provide any other details if needed.

Thanks for maintaining such a valuable resource!

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

## How to Find Broken Link Opportunities

**Tools:**
- Ahrefs Site Explorer: Find broken outbound links on competitor sites
- Check My Links (Chrome extension): Scan pages manually
- Dead Link Checker: Identify 404s on resource pages

**Best targets:**
- Resource pages and link roundups
- Older articles (3+ years) more likely to have dead links
- Authority sites with high domain ratings (they pass more link equity)

**Search operators:**
```
"yacht insurance" + "resources"
"marine insurance" + "further reading"
"boat insurance guide" + "helpful links"
inurl:resources yacht insurance
```

## Important Guidelines

**DO:**
- ✅ Verify the link is actually broken before emailing
- ✅ Ensure your replacement is genuinely relevant (same topic, similar depth)
- ✅ Provide the exact URL of the broken link so they can find it easily
- ✅ Frame it as helping them, not asking a favor
- ✅ Keep the email under 150 words

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Suggest your homepage as a replacement for a specific topic
- ❌ Claim your resource is "better"—just say it's "relevant" or "comprehensive"
- ❌ Reach out if your replacement doesn't genuinely match the context
- ❌ Send without confirming the link is actually broken
- ❌ Follow up if they don't respond (they're busy)

## Success Metrics

Track in your outreach spreadsheet:
- Broken links identified
- Emails sent
- Response rate
- Links updated
- Domain authority of sites where links were updated

Expect a 20-30% response rate and 10-15% link replacement rate. This is higher than cold outreach because you're providing genuine value (fixing their site).

## Pro Tips

1. **Prioritize high-authority targets:** A link from a DR 60+ site is worth 10 links from DR 20 sites
2. **Check Archive.org:** See what the old dead page covered to ensure your replacement truly matches
3. **Be patient:** Site owners may take weeks to update—don't rush them
4. **Screenshot the broken link:** If helpful, include a quick screenshot showing the 404 error
