## Email Template

**Subject:** Quick question about your [TOPIC] article

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I came across your article on [SPECIFIC TOPIC - e.g., "yacht insurance basics for first-time buyers"] and found it really helpful, especially the section on [SPECIFIC POINT THEY MADE].

I run MyYachtsInsurance.com, an educational resource focused on helping yacht owners understand coverage complexities. I noticed your piece discusses [CONCEPT - e.g., "agreed value vs actual cash value"] without linking to a detailed explanation.

We published a comprehensive guide that breaks down this concept with real-world examples and scenarios:
[YOUR_URL - e.g., https://www.myyachtsinsurance.com/agreed-value-vs-actual-cash-value]

Would you consider adding this as a citation for readers who want to dive deeper? I think it would add value for your audience, especially those shopping for policies who need to understand the implications.

Either way, thanks for creating quality content in this space!

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]
