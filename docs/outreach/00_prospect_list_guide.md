## Column Definitions

### Domain
**What it is:** The root domain of the target site
**Example:** `yachtworld.com` (not the full URL)
**Why track it:** Helps identify multiple opportunities on the same site

### Contact Name
**What it is:** First and last name of the person you're reaching out to
**Example:** `John Smith`
**How to find:** Check author bio, about page, LinkedIn, or contact page
**Pro tip:** Personalized emails to named individuals get 3x better response rates than "info@" addresses

### Contact Email
**What it is:** Email address for the contact person
**Example:** `john@yachtworld.com`
**How to find:**
- Author bio on articles
- Contact page
- Hunter.io or similar email finder tools
- LinkedIn contact info
**Avoid:** Generic addresses like info@, contact@, admin@ when possible

### Page URL
**What it is:** Full URL of the specific page you're targeting
**Example:** `https://yachtworld.com/resources/yacht-insurance-guide`
**Important:** Link to the specific article/resource page, not the homepage

### Page Title
**What it is:** The title of the page you're targeting
**Example:** `Complete Yacht Insurance Guide for First-Time Buyers`
**Why track it:** Helps you customize emails with specific references

### Outreach Type
**What it is:** The type of outreach email you'll send
**Options:**
- `Citation Request` - Asking to be cited in existing content
- `Broken Link` - Replacing a dead link with your resource
- `Resource Addition` - Pitching your asset for their resource page/roundup

**How to choose:** Match to the template that fits the opportunity

### Asset to Pitch
**What it is:** Which MyYachtsInsurance resource you're pitching
**Examples:**
- `Named Storm Calculator`
- `Hurricane Checklist`
- `Agreed Value Guide`
- `Hull & Machinery Guide`
- `P&I Liability Guide`

**Pro tip:** Always pitch the MOST relevant asset, not your homepage

### Angle/Context
**What it is:** Brief note about why your resource fits this target
**Examples:**
- `Resource page for Florida yacht owners - calculator fits hurricane prep section`
- `Article discusses ACV vs Agreed Value but lacks authoritative source`
- `Links to dead NOAA page about named storms - our guide is perfect replacement`

**Why track it:** Reminds you of the specific context when drafting your email weeks later

### Domain Authority
**What it is:** The site's authority score (0-100 scale)
**How to find:** Use Ahrefs, Moz, or similar SEO tool
**Why track it:** Prioritize high-authority targets (60+) for maximum link equity
**Benchmarks:**
- 0-30: Low authority (still valuable if highly relevant)
- 30-50: Medium authority
- 50-70: High authority (priority targets)
- 70+: Excellent authority (top priority)

### Status
**What it is:** Current stage of the outreach
**Options:**
- `Researched` - You've identified the opportunity but haven't reached out
- `Email Drafted` - You've prepared the email but haven't sent it
- `Contacted` - Email sent, awaiting response
- `Followed Up` - Sent follow-up email (use sparingly)
- `Link Acquired` - They added your link!
- `No Response` - They didn't respond after 2 weeks
- `Declined` - They said no
- `Not Relevant` - Upon review, not a good fit after all

### Date Added
**What it is:** When you added this prospect to the list
**Format:** YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., `2026-01-15`)
**Why track it:** Shows how long prospects sit in your pipeline

### Date Contacted
**What it is:** When you sent the initial outreach email
**Format:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Why track it:** Calculate response time and conversion rates

### Date Followed Up
**What it is:** When you sent a follow-up email (if applicable)
**Format:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Important:** Only follow up once, and only for high-value targets (DA 60+)

### Date Link Acquired
**What it is:** When they confirmed adding your link or you verified it's live
**Format:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Why track it:** Calculate conversion rate and time from outreach to success

### Notes
**What it is:** Any additional context, observations, or follow-up needed
**Examples:**
- `Site owner mentioned updating quarterly - check back in March`
- `Responded positively but needs to check with editor`
- `Broken link is in paragraph 3, line 2 of article body`
- `High DR but very slow to respond - contacted 3 weeks ago`

## Workflow: How to Use the Tracker

### 1. Research Phase (Weekly)

**Goal:** Find 10-20 prospects per week

**Process:**
1. Use search operators to find opportunities (see email templates for examples)
2. Evaluate each page for relevance and quality
3. Add prospects to spreadsheet with Status = `Researched`
4. Fill in all columns except contact dates
5. Sort by Domain Authority to prioritize high-value targets

**Time investment:** 2-3 hours per week

### 2. Email Drafting Phase (Weekly)

**Goal:** Draft 10 emails per week

**Process:**
1. Filter spreadsheet by Status = `Researched`
2. Sort by Domain Authority (highest first)
3. Select top 10 prospects
4. Draft personalized emails using appropriate template
5. Update Status to `Email Drafted`
6. Save drafts in your email client

**Time investment:** 1-2 hours per week

### 3. Sending Phase (Weekly)

**Goal:** Send 10 emails per week

**Process:**
1. Filter by Status = `Email Drafted`
2. Review each draft for personalization and relevance
3. Send emails
4. Update Status to `Contacted`
5. Fill in Date Contacted
6. Set calendar reminder to check responses in 1 week

**Time investment:** 30 minutes per week

**Important:** Don't send more than 10-15 emails per week. Quality > quantity.

### 4. Follow-Up Phase (As Needed)

**Goal:** Follow up on high-value non-responders after 2 weeks

**Process:**
1. Filter by Status = `Contacted`
2. Filter by Date Contacted older than 14 days
3. Identify high-DA targets (60+) worth a follow-up
4. Send brief, polite follow-up
5. Update Status and Date Followed Up

**Follow-up template:**
```
Hi [NAME],

Just following up on my email from [DATE] about [TOPIC]. I know you're
busy, so no worries if it's not a good fit!

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
```

**Important:** Only follow up ONCE, and only for DA 60+ targets.

### 5. Tracking Results (Ongoing)

**When they respond:**
- If they add your link: Update Status to `Link Acquired`, fill in Date Link Acquired
- If they decline: Update Status to `Declined`, add reason in Notes
- If they don't respond after 14 days: Update Status to `No Response`

**Monthly review:**
- Calculate response rate: (Responses / Emails Sent) * 100
- Calculate link acquisition rate: (Links Acquired / Emails Sent) * 100
- Identify which outreach types work best
- Double down on successful approaches

## Success Benchmarks

Based on industry averages for quality outreach:

| Metric | Good | Great | Excellent |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| Response Rate | 10-15% | 15-25% | 25%+ |
| Link Acquisition Rate | 5-8% | 8-12% | 12%+ |
| Avg Time to Link | 14-21 days | 7-14 days | <7 days |
| Avg DA of Links | 40-50 | 50-65 | 65+ |

**If your rates are lower:**
- Improve email personalization (mention something specific about their content)
- Target more relevant sites (is your resource genuinely a good fit?)
- Improve your linkable assets (are they actually valuable?)
- Check your email deliverability (are you landing in spam?)

## Monthly Reporting Template

Use this to track progress month-over-month:

```
MONTH: January 2026

Prospects Added: 45
Emails Sent: 38
Responses Received: 9 (23.7%)
Links Acquired: 4 (10.5%)
Average DA of Links: 58

Top Performing Outreach Type:
Broken Link Replacement (3 links acquired from 12 emails = 25%)

Notes:
- Resource addition pitches working well for marina sites
- Citation requests getting fewer responses - may need better personalization
- Average time from email to link: 11 days

Focus for Next Month:
- Find more broken link opportunities (highest conversion)
- Improve citation request personalization
- Target more marina and yacht club resource pages
```

## Advanced Tips

### Batch Processing
- Research 20 prospects on Monday
- Draft 10 emails on Wednesday
- Send 10 emails on Friday
- Batching is more efficient than one-at-a-time

### Prioritization Matrix
Sort prospects by this priority formula:
```
Priority Score = (Domain Authority / 10) + (Relevance Score 1-10)
```

Example:
- DA 70 site with perfect relevance (10) = Priority 17
- DA 40 site with medium relevance (5) = Priority 9

Focus on Priority 12+ first.

### Seasonal Opportunities
- **Feb-May:** Hurricane prep content (pitch Named Storm Calculator)
- **Jun-Aug:** Yacht buying season (pitch Agreed Value guide)
- **Sep-Nov:** Year-end insurance reviews (pitch comprehensive guides)
- **Dec-Jan:** Planning season (pitch checklists and tools)

### Link Velocity
Don't acquire too many links too fast—it looks unnatural to Google.

**Healthy velocity:**
- Month 1-2: 3-5 links
- Month 3-4: 5-8 links
- Month 5-6: 8-12 links
- Ongoing: 10-15 links/month

### Domain Diversity
Track referring domains, not just links. 100 links from 10 sites < 50 links from 50 sites.

**Goal:** Acquire links from diverse site types:
- Yacht clubs
- Marinas
- Boating magazines
- Insurance blogs
- Yacht brokers
- Marine surveyors
- Coastal news sites

✅ Pitch specific, relevant resources (guides, tools, calculators)

❌ **Following up multiple times**
✅ Follow up once max, and only for high-DA targets

❌ **Ignoring relevance for high DA**
✅ A relevant DA 40 link > an irrelevant DA 70 link
