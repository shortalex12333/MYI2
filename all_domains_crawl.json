This valuation method is commonly used in insurance claims to determine the payout a policyholder receives after a loss. Unlike replacement cost coverage, ACV considers depreciation, which often results in a lower compensation amount.\nKey Takeaways\nActual Cash Value (ACV) is calculated by subtracting depreciation from the replacement cost of a property at the time of loss.\nInsurance policies that use ACV usually result in lower payouts than those based on replacement cost, since ACV considers depreciation.\nPolicyholders often prefer replacement cost coverage because it reimburses the full cost of replacing the lost or damaged item.\nIn property and casualty insurance, ACV is commonly used to determine compensation for damaged or stolen goods.\nUnderstanding the Mechanics of Actual Cash Value\nSometimes, insurance companies use actual cash value to determine the amount to be paid to a policyholder after loss or damage to the insured property or vehicle. There isn't a type of insurance called ACV insurance, for example, that's a misconception.\nIn the case of an automobile that is totaled in an accident, for example, the insurance company would typically\npay the actual cash value of the vehicle\nafter determining its replacement cost and subtracting factors such as depreciation and wear and tear. Under replacement-cost coverage, the insurer would pay the amount required to replace the covered item with a like-kind new one.\nActual cash value\u00a0is used in valuing insured property in the property and casualty insurance industry.\nImportant\nActual cash value\u00a0is not the same as the\nreplacement cost value\nof an item.\nACV is found by subtracting depreciation from the replacement cost. Depreciation is based on how much of the item's life remains. This percentage,\u00a0multiplied by the replacement cost, provides the actual cash value. Some policies might include a\nrecoverable depreciation clause\n, allowing the owner to claim the depreciated value and the replacement actual cash value.\nPractical Example of Calculating Actual Cash Value\nAs an example: a man purchased a television set for $3,000 five years ago and it was destroyed in a hurricane. His insurance company says that all televisions have a useful life of 10 years. A similar television today costs $3,500. The destroyed television had 50%\u00a0(five years) of its life remaining. The actual cash value\u00a0equals $3,500 (replacement cost) times 50%\u00a0(useful life remaining) or $1,750.\nThis concept is different from the\nbook value\nused by accountants in financial statements or for tax purposes. Accountants use the purchase price and subtract the accumulated depreciation in order to value the item on a balance sheet. ACV uses the current\nreplacement cost of a new item\n.\nComparing Actual Cash Value and Replacement Cost\nMost policyholders prefer reimbursement for replacement cost instead of ACV, as these amounts often differ.\nFor instance, if a\u00a0camera is stolen, a replacement cost policy will reimburse you the full cost of replacing it with a new camera of like kind. The insurer will not take into consideration that the lost camera had\u00a0a shutter count of 25,000 because you\u00a0used the camera every day for the last two years, causing a considerable amount of wear and tear.\nThe Bottom Line\nUnderstanding Actual Cash Value (ACV) is crucial for policyholders who want to optimize their insurance coverage. ACV calculates the payout for damaged or stolen property based on the replacement cost minus depreciation, often resulting in a significantly lower reimbursement than replacement cost value.\nWhile ACV is regularly used in the property and casualty insurance industry to value insured properties, opting for replacement cost coverage might be more beneficial as it provides reimbursement for the current cost of replacing damaged items. Evaluating your policy type and understanding these concepts can lead to more informed decisions about your insurance needs.\nOpen a New Account\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\u00d7\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

When ranking high-yield savings account rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best savings account, like minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best high-yield savings account rates since 2019.\nWhat Is a High-Yield Savings Account?\nAs the name implies, high-yield savings accounts pay much higher interest rates than traditional ones. Often offered online, whether by an\ninternet-only bank\nor the online division of a\nbrick-and-mortar bank\n, they're a type of savings account that's based on the idea of holding your savings wherever it can earn a competitively high yield, even if that's a different bank than where you hold your checking account.\nThe difference in savings account interest rates can be dramatic, with the top accounts in the country typically offering 10 to 12 times the national average rate. And you can still keep your checking account where it is, because it's simple to link a\nhigh-yield savings account\nto your primary account for easy transfers.\nReasons to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nStashing some of your cash in a savings account is smart whether you're saving for something specific, or just want to sock money away for when you'll need it in the future. Here are some common reasons to open a savings account:\nBuild an emergency fund\n: By putting your emergency money in a high-yield account, you'll be able to boost your balance with monthly interest earnings, while also leaving your funds fully accessible should a financial emergency arise.\nReach a specific goal\n: This may include buying a house or a car, sending your son or daughter to college, or going on a special vacation.\nGrow your savings\n: Earning interest on your money means your savings balance will grow faster than if you were making monthly contributions and not earning anything.\nHow Much Will a High-Yield Savings Account Pay on $1,000, $5,000, or Higher Balances?\nThe amount of money you can earn in a high-yield savings account will be based on how much you deposit and what your interest rate is. Based on initial deposits of different amounts from $1,000 to $100,000, we calculate below what your balance would be at the end of one year if you put the funds in a top-paying high-yield savings account, paying 5.00%, vs. a savings account paying the national average of 0.39% APY.\nWarning\nNote that while you can earn a great deal more than the national average rate, your bank may also pay a lot less. For instance,\nChase\n,\nBank of America\n, and\nWells Fargo\nall pay close to zero interest on their traditional savings accounts, at just 0.01% APY.\nAPY\n$1,000 balance\n$2,500 balance\n$5,000 balance\n$10,000 balance\n$20,000 balance\n$50,000 balance\n$100,000 balance\n1 year of earnings at the national average rate\n0.39%\n$1,004\n$2,509\n$5,019\n$10,039\n$20,078\n$50,195\n$100,390\n1 year of earnings at today's top rate\n5.00%\n$1,050\n$2,625\n$5,250\n$10,500\n$21,000\n$52,500\n$105,000\nAdded earnings from HYSA\n+ $46\n+ $116\n+ $231\n+ $461\n+ $922\n+ $2,305\n+ $4,610\nOf course, you can boost your balance even more by regularly adding deposits to your savings account. One smart way to do this is to set up an automated transfer from your checking account once a month.\nHow to Choose the Best High-Yield Savings Account\nOnce you've decided to open up a new high-yield savings account, you'll want to do your homework to make sure you're choosing the best one for your needs. Searching for a top\nannual percentage yield (APY)\nis a good starting point when choosing a high-yield savings account, as you'll want to earn a competitive rate.\nThough the interest rate can change, it makes sense to choose an account that is paying one of the highest rates in the country, since the higher your rate, the more interest you'll collect every month and every year. Also, through the\npower of compounding\n, you can make interest off your interest, and the higher the APY on your account, the better.\nBut beyond the interest rate, you'll also want to make sure the account either doesn't have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that you feel confident you can regularly maintain. Also, note if there is a minimum balance required to earn the top APY.\nWhy Different Banks Pay Different Rates\nEach bank is a business that has different needs for customer deposits, operating in its own regional market. As a result, some banks have to work harder to attract funds, such as smaller banks with names you may not be familiar with.\nAlso important is the lending activity the bank is undertaking. If, for instance, a bank is in a strategic push to build its commercial lending portfolio, it will need to attract more customer deposits in order to fund those loans it hopes to make. One way they can do this is offering a promotional APY for a short period to boost their deposits balance, but then lowering it after they've accumulated enough funds.\nCommon Savings Account Terms to Understand\nWhen researching high-yield savings accounts to find the best one for you, be sure you understand what these commonly used terms mean.\nMinimum opening deposit or initial deposit\n: Some bank accounts\u2014whether a savings, checking, or money market account\u2014stipulate a minimum deposit you need to make to open the account. It could be quite low, like $25, or could be as much as $25,000 for some high-balance accounts. And some accounts have no requirement, letting you open the account with no money deposited. Note that if an account has a initial deposit requirement but then no minimum ongoing balance, you do not need to keep that money at the bank after your initial deposit.\nMinimum balance requirement or ongoing balance\n: Unlike a minimum initial deposit, a\nminimum balance requirement\nrefers to the least amount of money you can keep in the account on an\nongoing\nbasis. For instance, a bank may require your balance to stay at or above $100 or $1,000 for its account\u2014or any other amount the bank prefers. Falling below the minimum requirement could mean being hit with a fee, or could instead mean you won't earn the high-yield interest rate on the account. So be sure the account you choose either has no minimum ongoing balance or one that you feel confident you can always stay above.\nMonthly maintenance fee\n: Banks and credit unions charge various types of fees. Unlike ones triggered by a transaction, such as an\ninsufficient funds\nfee or a\nwire transfer\nfee, the monthly service fee is a standard fee you could be charged every statement cycle. Many accounts do not have a monthly maintenance fee, while some others provide ways for you to avoid the fee each month. Be sure you understand the fee rules for any account you're considering.\nMobile check deposit\n: The ability to deposit checks using the camera on your smartphone or tablet\u2014rather than having to take the check to a branch\u2014is called\nmobile check deposit\nor remote check deposit. Most institutions' mobile apps offer this as an easy way to get money deposited into your account.\nExternal or ACH transfer\n: The electronic process of moving funds between two financial institutions is called an external or\nACH transfer\n. Virtually every high-yield savings account allows you to send or receive external transfers so that you can easily move money in and out of your savings account.\nHow to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nAfter comparing the best high-yield savings account and landing on a choice, the next step is to open the account online. Here's how that generally works:\nThe bank or credit union will ask you to provide various personal information, including your social security number, since your interest earnings will be reportable to the IRS.\nThe bank's account opening process will also involve security measures designed to ensure you are who you say you are.\nYou'll also be presented with one or more options on how to fund your account. The most common method is by ACH transfer from another bank, and you'll be provided with instructions on how to set this up.\nAlternatively, some institutions allow you to make your initial deposit with a debit card, a credit card, or even a paper check sent through the mail.\nOnce the application process is completed, you may be able to set up online banking right away, or you may need to wait a day or two for your account to be fully opened.\nTip\nTransfers between different institutions will take one to three days to complete, so be sure to keep enough of a cash cushion either in your checking account or in a linked savings account at that same institution. That way you won\u2019t run into trouble if you can\u2019t get funds from your high-yield account for a couple of days.\nPros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts\nPros\nHigher APY than traditional savings accounts\nAbility to withdraw or deposit funds at any time\nExtremely safe, with virtually no risk\nExcellent vehicle for an emergency fund or saving for a big goal\nIn times of rising rates, your APY may go up\nCons\nEarning a top yield may require opening an account with a new institution\nSome accounts have withdrawal limits of six per month\nEasy access can make it tempting to dip into savings\nAccount could have a fee or minimum balance requirement\nIn times of decreasing rates, your APY may go down\nWho Is a High-Yield Savings Account Best For?\nAnyone with surplus savings in the bank can benefit from a high-yield savings account. If you have more money in the bank than you need to hold in your checking account, high-yield savings accounts offer a way to sock some of those funds away to earn an especially high\nannual percentage yield (APY)\n. High-yield savings accounts are also well suited to those comfortable with internet or mobile banking, as moving money in and out of an online savings account must generally be done on your computer or via a mobile banking app on your phone.\nWhen choosing the best savings account for you, you'll want to check the rules of the account, such as whether it limits the number of withdrawals you can make in a month, and if you'll be assessed a monthly maintenance fee. Lastly, check that the bank is an FDIC member (or an NCUA member if it's a credit union) so that your money is insured by the federal government\u2014up to $250,000 per depositor\u2014should the bank or credit union fail. Online reviews of a bank's customer service may also prove useful.\nAlternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts\nHigh-yield savings accounts are just one vehicle for stashing your cash, and they often pay the highest APYs. But there are several\nalternatives for holding your funds\nuntil you need them.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Checking Account\nWhile the\neasiest\nplace to keep surplus funds is in your\nchecking account\n, this has two major downsides. First, money kept in your everyday checking account is very easy to spend, making it difficult to leave earmarked as savings. Second, checking accounts tend not to pay any interest\u2014or if they do, the rate is a pittance. A high-yield savings account offers an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on your money.\nSome\nhigh-yield or rewards checking\naccounts do exist, with rates that are more competitive. But these accounts require jumping through some hoops\u2014sometimes every month\u2014in order to earn their high rate. Still, if you're a heavy debit card user, one of the best rewards checking accounts may be a good option for you.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Traditional Savings Account\nThere is no formal definition of how high a rate needs to be to qualify as \"high yield\". In short, it's up to each institution how to name their savings accounts. Traditional banks and credit unions more often offer traditional savings accounts, while online banks are more likely to offer a high-yield savings account. But again, the distinctions are fuzzy, rather than hard-and-fast rules.\nWhy You Don't See Big Name Banks on Our List\nWe track the savings account rates of over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. While we do check the rates at big banks\u2014including the five largest banks of Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, and U.S. Bank\u2014their rates aren't usually high enough to make our ranking. Meanwhile, other institutions may not qualify for our ranking because they aren't available to customers in at least 40 states, or they significantly limit the balance on which you can earn their high-yield APY.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Money Market Account\nA\nmoney market account\noperates very much like a savings account, with the exception that it allows writing checks. In the past, money market accounts typically imposed high minimum deposit requirements in exchange for higher rates than savings accounts. This has shifted in recent years, however, with savings and money market accounts both having a variety of required minimum balances\u2014including no-minimums accounts. In addition, high-yield savings accounts often pay more competitive rates than money markets, though sometimes you can find a higher APY among the\ntop-paying money market accounts\n.\nFinancial Advisor Insight\n\"When a client has money they won't need in the next 12 to 24 months, I encourage them to take advantage of a high-yield savings account or money market account to hedge against inflation as well remove the funds from their actively used checking accounts. Basically, a 'hands off account,'\" said\nSibyl Slade\n, a member of\nInvestopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council\n.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Certificate of Deposit (CD)\nIf some of your savings can be socked away and not touched for a period of time, you may be able to earn a higher rate with a\ncertificate of deposit\n. CDs require you to commit your funds to remain on deposit for a number of months or years, imposing a penalty if you request to withdraw the funds before the CD\u2019s maturity date. But in exchange, your interest rate is locked and guaranteed, even if the Fed lowers rates. Our daily ranking of the\nbest nationwide CDs\ncan lead you to the highest available APYs no matter the CD term you choose.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat Does \"HYSA\" Mean?\nHYSA is simply an abbreviation for \"high-yield savings account.\" In contrast to traditional savings accounts,\nhigh-yield savings accounts\naim to attract customers and their deposits by offering a much more competitive interest rate.\nWhat Are the Best High-Yield Savings Accounts?\nThe top-paying institutions for savings accounts vary, with no one bank consistently leading the rate rankings. In general, the top rate contenders tend to be online operations, whether owned by a physical bank or set up as a fully online-only institution. You can always find today's highest rates\u2014currently near 5.00%\u2014and the institutions that offer them by regularly checking our ranking in this article. Or for a list that is exclusive to banks (no credit unions), you can check our daily ranking of the\nbest banks for savings accounts\n.\nAre High-Yield Savings Accounts Worth It?\nFor cash savings that you want easy access to, it's hard to beat a high-yield savings account. You can earn a competitive rate\u2014above inflation\u2014and you can withdraw the money whenever you need. They're more liquid than\nCDs\n, which lock your money up for a specific amount of time, and they're less risky than stock investing because you can't lose money (other than through account fees, which can usually be avoided).\nHow Do High-Yield Savings Accounts Work?\nHigh-yield savings accounts work just like regular savings accounts. You begin by applying for an account with a bank or credit union. If approved, you'll make a deposit to fund your account, and will begin earning interest. You can add more funds whenever you'd like, and you can typically withdraw the money whenever you'd like, although some institutions still have monthly limits.\nIn some cases, however, HYSAs have extra requirements to earn the high rate that you won't find with regular savings accounts.\nAre High-Yield Savings Accounts Taxed?\nYes, you must\npay taxes on the earnings\nof a savings account. The interest you earn from a bank account\u2014whether paid on a savings, checking, money market, or CD account\u2014will need to be reported on your annual tax return. You'll be able to see on your monthly statement or online register how much you were paid each month, and at the end of the calendar year, it will be taxed along with all of your other income from employment and other sources.\nThe bank where you hold your high-yield savings account will not tax you directly, but in January of each year, they will send you and the IRS a Form 1099-INT indicating how much interest you were paid in the previous calendar year. You must then report this interest income on your tax return.\nAre High-Yield Savings Accounts Safe?\nYes, high-yield savings accounts are generally considered safe. In a worst-case scenario, a savings account will pay no interest, meaning your funds don't grow at all. But you would never lose the money you put into the account, other than due to fees you've been assessed. So it's important to choose an account where you can easily avoid paying any fees.\nAs for losing money due to a bank failure, the vast majority of banks\u2014whether physical or online\u2014are covered by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\n, which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits per institution if the bank fails.\nThe U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers for up to $250,000 by providing insurance through the\nNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA)\n.\nThat means whether your dealing with a traditional brick-and-mortar bank, an online bank, or a credit union, your deposits up to $250,000 are equally safe and protected.\nDoes Chase Have a High-Yield Savings Account?\nAlthough\nChase has savings accounts\n, they aren't high-yield accounts. Chase accounts usually offer very low rates, even the Premier Savings account. We suggest keeping your extra cash elsewhere, like one of the high-yield savings accounts above.\nWhich Banks Do You Track for High-Yield Savings Accounts?\nEvery business day, we check the savings account rate for about 100 banks and credit unions that offer their accounts to customers nationwide.

We determine daily rankings of the top-paying savings accounts first and foremost by the annual percentage yield (APY) offered. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (\nFDIC\nfor banks,\nNCUA\nfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the savings account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.\nFor more about how we choose the best high-yield savings accounts,\nread our full methodology\n.\nLearn More About High-Yield Savings Accounts\nWhat Is a High-Yield Savings Account?\nWhat Is an APY?\nHow to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\nBest High-Yield Business Savings Accounts\nBest Banks for Savings Accounts\nHow Many Savings Accounts Should I Have?\nWhy Choose a Money Market Instead of a Savings Account\nBest Money Market Accounts\nSavings Account vs. Roth IRA: What's the Difference?\nRevolut Disclosure\n**The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is a variable rate and may change at any time.

term premiums remain level, while permanent premiums often rise with age.\nThe older you are, the more challenging it becomes to qualify for coverage due to stricter medical exams and underwriting.\nBuying life insurance younger can reduce premium costs over a lifetime as insurers expect fewer claims earlier in life.\nAge influences your risk classification, affecting both eligibility for policies and premium rates.\nLife insurance is a financial product that offers a death benefit to beneficiaries upon the policyholder's passing, and age is one of the primary factors affecting its premiums. Rates are heavily influenced by age, making it crucial to understand how your age impacts the cost before purchasing a policy.\nLearn why age is a pivotal consideration, how premiums are structured, and ways to keep costs manageable. We'll help you understand how insurance companies assess risks and why securing a policy at a younger age might save you money.\nUnderstanding Life Insurance Premiums\nLife insurance is designed to pay out a death benefit to the person or persons you name as beneficiaries when you pass away. In exchange for this coverage, you pay a premium to the life insurance company. In the case of\nterm life insurance\n, you'd pay these premiums for a set term prescribed by the policy. These policies have a set expiration date. With\npermanent life insurance\ncoverage, premiums are due as long as the policy remains in effect which can last your entire life.\nCompanies that sell life insurance use actuarial tables to help set life insurance rates. Actuarial tables are used to estimate life expectancy and mortality rates. These tables, along with other factors, determine how much you'll pay for life insurance coverage.\nTip\nTerm life insurance policies typically offer lower premium rates at first compared to permanent life insurance.\nFactors Influencing Your Life Insurance Premiums\nWhen calculating how much you'll pay for life insurance, your\nrisk class\ncomes into play. Life insurance companies assign applicants to various risk classes, based on factors such as:\nAge\nGender\nOverall health, including weight and the presence of preexisting conditions\nSmoking status\nFamily history\nOccupation\nParticipation in risky hobbies, such as hang-gliding or sky-diving\nIf you're assigned to the best risk class, which may be referred to as Preferred Plus or Elite, depending on the insurance company, you'll typically pay the lowest premiums due to being lower risk. On the other hand, you may pay the most for life insurance if you're assigned a substandard rate based on health, smoking status, age, or other risk factors. Overall, age is the most important contributor to both term and permanent life insurance rates.\nIn addition, if you\u2019re considering a whole life or\nuniversal\npolicy, the\nrate of return\non the cash value will drive the premium up or down. A higher rate of return on cash value can go a long way toward keeping policy premiums to a minimum. A lower-than-expected return on cash value will require a higher funding amount to keep the policy in force longer.\nTip\nChanging occupations, losing weight, or quitting smoking could all help to improve your insurance risk classification and lower your premiums.\nHow Age Impacts Life Insurance Costs\nThe annual premium, or \u201crate,\u201d for a term life insurance policy is determined at the time of purchase and set for the duration of the policy. Typically, the premium amount increases on average by about 8% to 10% for every year of age, according to Ted Bernstein, Owner, Life Cycle Planners, LLC.\n\u201cA 45-year-old male will pay on average $1,125 per year for a new, 20-year term policy with $1,000,000 of coverage,\u201d he says. \u201cThe same policy purchased at age 46, will cost $1,225\u2014and $1,345 a year if purchased at age 47.\u201d The reason every year inches up the cost of term life insurance is simple math. Every birthday puts you one year closer to your\nlife expectancy\n, making you more expensive to insure.\nTo be able to hold term life insurance prices steady after you buy\u2014rather than raising premiums every birthday\u2014insurers spread the premiums you would pay over the entire term (10, 20, 30 years, etc.) and average them into one payment. Instead of paying low premiums when you\u2019re young and very high premiums when you\u2019re older, you pay the same amount every year for your set term.\nOnce the term of your current policy expires, you could renew but will face a very steep rate increase.\u00a0The insurance carrier will adjust the premium to reflect your new age at renewal.\nTo show how age affects life insurance rates, we collected policy quotes for term policies from\nQuotacy\n. These rates are for a non-smoker buying a 20-year term policy in the 10003 area code (Manhattan).\nLife Insurance Rates by Age\nAge\nGender\n$250,000\n$500,000\n$750,000\n$1,000,000\n25\nMale\n$12.76\n$18.58\n$24.48\n$30.99\nFemale\n$11.20\n$16.47\n$21.31\n$23.73\n30\nMale\n$12.97\n$19.11\n$25.27\n$33.43\nFemale\n$11.46\n$16.47\n$21.31\n$25.24\n35\nMale\n$13.93\n$21.04\n$28.57\n$36.09\nFemale\n$12.95\n$18.41\n$24.22\n$30.62\n40\nMale\n$19.55\n$30.59\n$42.88\n$54.80\nFemale\n$16.91\n$24.82\n$33.84\n$45.40\n45\nMale\n$28.47\n$45.82\n$65.34\n$85.31\nFemale\n$23.74\n$37.93\n$53.50\n$68.40\n50\nMale\n$41.86\n$72.66\n$105.60\n$136.52\nFemale\n$34.21\n$56.76\n$81.75\n$108.37\n55\nMale\n$66.09\n$117.32\n$172.59\n$220.97\nFemale\n$49.09\n$84.00\n$122.61\n$162.49\n60\nMale\n$117.32\n$212.17\n$315.26\n$418.34\nFemale\n$84.07\n$142.17\n$209.86\n$275.15\nMonthly life insurance rates for a 20-year term life policy\nPermanent life policy premium rates also get more expensive as you age. After you sign up, the premiums may either stay the same, like with whole life, or they vary, like with universal life. If they vary, the cost usually rises as you age. Ideally, you should build up a reserve of cash value while you're young to help cover these rising insurance costs as you get older. Otherwise, you would need to pay more yourself to cover these rising costs or else you'd lapse your policy.\nEligibility Criteria for Life Insurance Coverage\nAge can impact whether you qualify for life\ninsurance coverage\nat all, including what products you could apply for. For example, many carriers set a maximum age limit of 75 or 80 for new applicants.\nYou couldn't sign up if you are past this age limit.\nOther requirements also increase as you age. Every carrier has\nunderwriting\nrequirements that typically involve certain health-related testing. The older you are, the more testing\u00a0a carrier will require. For instance, a 40-year-old applying for $500,000 of coverage with AIG will likely be required to have a paramedical exam, including blood and urine tests. If they apply over the age of 70, however, the same person looking to purchase the same coverage may need to have a resting EKG along with the medical exam and lab work.\nAdditional testing requirements certainly can have an effect on rates because they can catch more health issues. In the case of more senior applicants, life insurance carriers have also begun assessing one's mental condition. Applicants can be declined for failing a cognitive evaluation such as a memory recall test.\nNote\nNo exam life insurance policies allow you to get coverage without a medical exam. But you may pay higher premium costs.\nAt What Age Should You Get Life Insurance?\nLife insurance will be less expensive when you are younger and healthy. If you will need life insurance coverage in the future (e.g., you plan to have a family or send a child to college several years down the road), it may make sense to get it while you are younger to reduce your annual premiums.\nAs You Get Older, What Happens to the Cost of Life Insurance?\nLife insurance premiums will increase on a policy if you buy it when you are older. At a certain point, insurers will decline coverage altogether. Most insurers set a maximum age limit of 75 or 80 to buy a new policy.\nIs There Life Insurance Where Premiums Do Not Increase With Age?\nAll life insurance policies get more expensive to buy as you age. After you sign up, there are policies where the premiums do not increase over time as you age. Whole life keeps the same premium your entire life. Term life maintains the same premium during the term, though costs go up if you renew once the term expires.\nDo Women Pay More by Age for Life Insurance?\nNo. In general and all else equal, women tend to pay lower life insurance premiums than men. This is because women tend to live longer than men, on average.\nThe Bottom Line\nBecause every year of your life can tack dollars on your life insurance premium, try to buy any policy you\u2019re considering before your next birthday. To ensure you receive the best rates for the coverage you\u2019re seeking, obtain quotes from two or three of the best life insurance companies you can find.\nIf you're still looking, consider talking to an\nindependent agent\n, who works with more than one insurance company.

The type of FICO or Vantage score can vary depending on the type of loan being applied for.\u00a0 For example, lenders use a specific score variation from one of the major score providers for credit cards vs a mortgage or home equity line of credit.\nLearn More:\nFICO Score vs. Credit Score\nWhat are the most important components of credit?\nThe most important components of credit include history of on-time payments, types of credit owned, amounts owed and credit utilization. Another thing that goes into a person\u2019s credit score is the length of credit history, which means the age of the oldest account on file.\nLearn More:\nWhat Lenders Look at on Your Credit Report\nIs a credit card different from a line of credit?\nA credit card is a card-based form of payment that has a revolving credit line. It is different from a line of credit that is typically a standalone loan with a set loan amount that can be accessed as needed with a check. Once a check is written against a line of credit principal and interest is paid back in installments.\nLearn More:\nRevolving Credit vs. Line of Credit: What's the Difference?\nWhat behaviors affect credit scores?\nCredit scores can be positively or negatively affected by consumer behavior such as paying balances owed on or before the due date, the percentage of utilization of credit lines and the number of credit accounts that are open.\nLearn More:\n7 Things You Didn't Know Affect Your Credit Score\nWhat things get reported to credit bureaus\nLenders report the opening and maintenance of credit accounts to credit reporting companies each month that accounts are open.

Ultimately, credit is based on trust between the lender and borrower that the amount owed will be repaid. Credit generally entails measurement and verification of the creditworthiness of the borrower by the lender.\nLearn More\nHard Inquiry\nA hard inquiry refers to a lender pulling a full credit report on an individual from a credit reporting company in order to determine their creditworthiness for a loan or revolving line of credit. A hard inquiry can temporarily lower the credit applicant\u2019s credit score as where a soft inquiry, which entails a more cursory view of a borrower\u2019s credit, does not.\nLearn More\nCredit Rating\nCredit rating generally refers to an individual\u2019s creditworthiness as measured by a credit score. It can also apply to corporate entities as it relates to the ability of a company to borrow money in the capital markets or issue debt instruments such as corporate bonds.\nLearn More\nCredit History\nCredit history is the accumulated credit account behavior of an individual that is tracked by credit reporting agencies. Lenders such as banks and credit card issuers report their customers\u2019 accounts, credit usage and payment behavior to credit reporting agencies such as Experian, Equifax and TransUnion each month, forming credit profiles.\nLearn More\nCredit Quality\nCredit quality is another term for creditworthiness, meaning the level at which lenders assign credit amounts and terms based on risk level. Banks and other types of lenders measure credit quality objectively using credit scores based on factors such as types of credit owned, on-time payment history, credit utilization and age of credit.\nLearn More\nBuy Now, Pay Later\nBuy Now, Pay Later, also known as BNPL, is a relatively recent take on the old layaway plans of the past. However, unlike layaway plans, Buy Now, Pay Later allows the buyer to take possession of the goods immediately and break up payments into four equal installments over a short period of time.\nLearn More\nWhere Does Your Credit Score Stand Compared to the National Average?\nShould You Consider Applying for Debt Relief Before the Holidays This Year?\nCheck Your Credit Score for Free Whenever You Want With These 7 Services (But There\u2019s a Catch)\nDon't Ignore That Weird Address On Your Credit Reports\u2014Do This Instead\nWhy Your Credit Scores Never Match\u2014and Which One Actually Matters\nExplore Credit & Debt\nAll\nBest Credit Repair Companies\nDefinitions A - M\nDefinitions N - Z\nBuy Now Pay Later\nMore\nBuilding Credit\nDebt Management\nYou Might Have Less Debt Than You Think, Compared With the Average American\u2014Here's Where You Rank\nHow Rewards Cards Can Affect Your Credit\nWhat Happens to Your Credit When You Get Married?\nThis Is the Best Time to Shop for a Loan So You Don't Ding Your Credit Score\nHow One ER Visit Can Wreck Your Credit\u2014And What You Can Do About It\nEver Wonder What\u2019s Actually in Your Credit Report?

It often arises in total-loss situations and can affect a policyholder's settlement if the salvage value offsets the claim. Insurers usually require written notice of abandonment to exercise these rights.\nHow Abandonment and Salvage Function\nAbandonment and salvage is a term that can surface fairly frequently in insurance contracts. When such a clause is present, it indicates that the insurer has the ability to rightfully claim an insured\nasset\nor piece of property that has been destroyed and subsequently abandoned by its owners.\nFor the insurer to salvage the item, the owner must first express an intent of\nabandonment\nin writing. Once that process is complete, the insurance company could choose to take full possession of the damaged property after paying out its insured value to the policyholder.\nThe selling value of the property can surpass the amount paid out on the claim, so salvage rights are sometimes legally contested by several parties.\nReal-World Examples of Abandonment and Salvage\nIn marine insurance, the insured has the right to abandon the property subject to acceptance by the insurer. If acceptance is granted, the insurer pays a\ntotal loss\n, usually the maximum settlement possible according to the terms of the insurance policy, then takes over the salvage as owner, regardless of any amount received from its subsequent sale.\nNon-marine policies usually prohibit abandonment by the insured and the claiming of total loss. However, the insurers may waive this condition in appropriate circumstances, if merited. For example, if a vessel sinks and is deemed too expensive to reclaim, it may be declared abandoned.\u00a0The insurer could then claim ownership and salvage rights to the sunken ship.\nImportant\nAdvancements in technology have made it possible and financially viable to reach previously inaccessible wrecks, resulting in increased salvage claims.\nAlternatively, cargo on a vessel may be damaged by insured\nperil\n, such as lightning or being washed overboard, resulting in a total loss of the cargo.\u00a0The insured files the claim, and the insurer settles the claim for the total loss.\nThe insured must transfer all rights, ownership, and interest of the damaged cargo to the insurer, after which the insurer becomes the owner of the damaged remaining cargo, which is known as salvage.\u00a0The process of transferring rights of the damaged asset or property is called\nsubrogation\n.\nImportant Considerations for Abandonment and Salvage\nIn cases of partial loss and salvage, the insured can claim only the amount of the loss or damage sustained, meaning they cannot abandon the property and\u00a0claim\u00a0full value.\nIf the insured surrenders the remains of the property and the insurer also agrees to accept the salvage, the claim would be paid in full and the insurer would become the owner of the salvage.\u00a0In cases of clear-cut total losses, insurance would pay in full, so the insurer is entitled to the benefit of the salvage.\nWith an\nunderinsured\ntotal loss, the insured would not be fully covered. They would be entitled to salvage, but only to the extent that the loss payment plus the value of salvage does not exceed the full loss or actual\nindemnity\n.\nIn the case of full coverage, on the other hand, the loss would be paid in full. The insurers become the absolute owners of the salvage, if any, and the total sale proceeds belong to them, even though the proceeds might be more than the amount of the claim paid.\nThe Bottom Line\nAbandonment and salvage clauses let insurers claim and recover property that an owner abandons as destroyed, most often in marine insurance. If accepted, the insurer may pay a total-loss claim and take salvage rights, while non-marine policies usually bar abandonment unless waived.\nPartial-loss claims generally cover only the damage sustained, while improved recovery technology has increased salvage disputes.\nOpen a New Account\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\u00d7\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

It hit the sweet spot in our scoring rubric: low APRs, a wide range of loan amounts, and a very wide range of repayment options. If you need a large sum, for a home improvement or a boat, LightStream lends up to $100,000. You\u2019ll have up to 20 years to repay for specific loan uses (like home improvements).\nPros & Cons\nPros\nLow APRs\nNo fees\nLoan amounts up to $100,000\nLoan terms up to 240 months (20 years)\nSame-day funding\nCons\nHigh minimum loan amount\nNo pre-qualification\nRequires good to excellent credit\nLimited customer support options\nOverview\nIn our research, LightStream scored well in all the areas that matter most to most borrowers. Its advertised APRs are competitive, and there are no fees, not even for late payments. It offers lengthy repayment terms and loan amounts of up to $100,000. With autopay, you can shave 0.50% of your APR. If you find a better rate on an unsecured loan from another lender, LightStream will beat it by 0.10%.\nFund dispersal is fast, as soon as the same day if you accept a loan proposal before 2:30 p.m. ET. You can also delay funding up to 90 days, which can help if you\u2019re planning a home improvement and don\u2019t want to begin repaying a loan before you\u2019ve spent any of it.\nAlthough LightStream is our top choice, it has some flaws. The most glaring is the lack of loan pre-qualification, which Investopedia considers an important shopping tool. You\u2019ll have to complete an application to find out your loan details, which means a small hit to your credit score.\nLightStream\u2019s minimum loan amount of $5,000 may be too high for some borrowers, depending on their needs. LightStream is a solid choice if you have good to excellent credit, but you\u2019ll have to shop elsewhere if you don't. Finally, we also found LightStream\u2019s customer service options lacking, as they are limited to telephone support.\nLightStream is the online-lending arm of Truist Bank, which was formed by a merger between BB&T and SunTrust Bank in 2019. Truist is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nAdditional Details\nMinimum Credit Score\n680\nOrigination Fees\nNone\nMembership Requirement\nNone\nAvailable Discounts\n0.50% autopay; 0.10% rate beat\nRead the Full\nLightStream Personal Loans Review\nAlso Good for Large Loan Amounts\n:\nSoFi\nInvestopedia's Rating\n4.7\nout of 5 stars\nAPR Range:\n8.74% - 35.49%\nLoan Amount:\n$5,000 - $100,000\nLoan Terms:\n24 months - 84 months\nCheck Rates\n(opens in a new tab)\nOn Investopedia\nWhy We Chose It\nSoFi, a former Best Overall winner in Investopedia\u2019s ranking, offers loans of up to $100,000, highly rated customer service, pre-qualification, and a bevy of SoFi membership benefits.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nNo late fees\nSame-day funding available\nAccess to SoFi membership benefits\nCons\nOptional origination fees\nCan\u2019t apply with a co-signer, but co-borrowers are accepted\nHigh minimum loan amounts\nOverview\nYou can find lenders offering lower rates and more flexible loan minimums. But only a few lenders we researched offer loan amounts up to $100,000, and only one, specialty lender BHG Financial, offers larger ones (up to $200,000). Plus, you\u2019re unlikely to find a lender that offers more customer perks and benefits than SoFi. Those benefits include free financial advice and discounts on other banking and financial products it offers.\nThat focus on customer experience is working for SoFi. It ranked fourth in J.D. Power\u2019s 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.\nSofi also received an Investopedia Combined Consumer Review rating of 4.4 (out of 5 possible), a calculated aggregate of consumer review ratings on Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau developed by Investopedia\u2019s researchers.\nLike LightStream, SoFi has a high loan minimum of $5,000, so if you need a smaller loan, you must look elsewhere. In years past, the lender touted its lack of fees. That\u2019s changed now, and SoFi offers borrowers the option to pay an origination fee of up to 7% in exchange for a lower interest rate overall. You still won\u2019t face late fees and\nprepayment fees\n.\nSan Francisco-based SoFi was founded in 2011 as a fintech specializing in student loans. Today, it offers a full suite of banking and financial products, including checking and savings accounts, home loans, investment accounts, insurance, and more.\nAdditional Details\nMinimum Credit Score\nNo stated minimum\nOrigination Fees\n0%\u20137.00%\nMembership Requirement\nNone\nAvailable Discounts\n0.25% autopay; 0.25% direct deposit; 0.25% creditor direct pay\nDisclosures\nFixed rates from 8.74% APR to 35.49% APR. APR reflects the 0.25% autopay discount and a 0.25% direct deposit discount. SoFi Platform personal loans are made either by SoFi Bank, N.A. or, Cross River Bank, a New Jersey State Chartered Commercial Bank, Member FDIC, Equal Housing Lender. SoFi may receive compensation if you take out a loan originated by Cross River Bank. These rate ranges are current as of 11/03/25 and are subject to change without notice. Not all rates and amounts available in all states. See SoFi Personal Loan eligibility details at\nhttps://www.sofi.com/eligibility-criteria/#eligibility-personal\n. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including evaluation of your credit worthiness, income, and other factors. Loan amounts range from $5,000\u2013 $100,000. The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and reflects both your interest rate and an origination fee of 9.99% of your loan amount for Cross River Bank originated loans which will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive and for SoFi Bank originated loans have an origination fee of 0%-7%, will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive. The SoFi 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. Autopay is not required to receive a loan from SoFi. To be eligible to receive an additional (0.25%) interest rate reduction on your Personal Loan (your \u201cLoan\u201d), you must set up Direct deposit with a SoFi Checking and Savings account offered by SoFi Bank, N.A., or enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee, all within 30 days of the funding of your Loan. Once eligible, you will receive this discount during periods in which you have enabled Direct Deposit to an eligible Direct Deposit Account in accordance with SoFi\u2019s reasonable procedures and requirements to be determined at SoFi\u2019s sole discretion, or during periods in which SoFi successfully receives payment of the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. This discount will be lost during periods in which SoFi determines you have turned off Direct Deposit to your Checking and Savings account or in which you have not paid for the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. You are not required to enroll in Direct Deposit or to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee to receive a Loan.\nRead the Full\nSoFi Personal Loans Review\nBest for Debt Consolidation\n:\nDiscover\nInvestopedia's Rating\n4.4\nout of 5 stars\nAPR Range:\n7.99% - 24.99%\nLoan Amount:\n$2,500 - $40,000\nLoan Terms:\n36 months - 84 months\nCheck Rates\n(opens in a new tab)\nOn Investopedia\nWhy We Chose It\nDiscover, with competitive APRs and no origination fee, is a good choice for personal loans for any reason. But because it will pay your creditors directly, it\u2019s an especially good choice for debt consolidation.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nNo origination fee or late fee\nExcellent customer satisfaction ratings\nCreditor direct pay\nCons\nNo co-signers or co-borrowers\nLower maximum loan amount\nCan\u2019t be used for secured debt consolidation\nOverview\nWe picked Discover as the best lender for\ndebt consolidation\nbecause of its low advertised APRs, range of repayment terms, and the option to have Discover pay your creditors directly. This is convenient for you, but also offers a bit of risk reduction for the lender. Loan funding is fast, as soon as the next business day, if everything in your application is accurate.\nDiscover\u2019s reputation for customer service was borne out during our research. Our reviewers rated the website and its broad collection of tools, calculators, and educational material a 4 (out of 5 possible). Meanwhile, Discover rated second in the J.D. Powers 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.\nOne downside with Discover is that it does not accept co-signers or co-borrowers who can help borrowers with lower credit scores qualify for a loan. The maximum loan amount ($40,000) is not as high as many competing lenders, although the lower minimum ($2,500) makes it a good choice if you\u2019re looking for a smaller loan.\nDiscover, founded in 1986, was a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company, which was created to offer Sears shoppers credit card services. Today, from its headquarters in Illinois, it offers credit cards, home loans, CDs, and savings and checking accounts.\nAdditional Details\nMinimum Credit Score\n660\nOrigination Fees\nNone\nMembership Requirement\nNone\nAvailable Discounts\nNone\nRead the Full\nDiscover Personal Loans Review\nBest for Emergency/Quick Funding\n:\nUpgrade\nInvestopedia's Rating\n4.2\nout of 5 stars\nAPR Range:\n7.74% - 35.99%\nLoan Amount:\n$1,000 - $50,000\nLoan Terms:\n24 months - 84 months\nCheck Rates\n(opens in a new tab)\nOn Investopedia\nWhy We Chose It\nUpgrade is our choice for emergencies and quick funding because of its fast funding time and relaxed lending criteria, which makes a loan from Upgrade available to a broad range of borrowers in a pinch.

You can apply with a co-borrower, too, if you need help getting approved or want to try for a better rate. Upgrade may also offer you a\nsecured loan\n, using your car as collateral, instead of an unsecured loan.\nYou\u2019ll pay for this flexibility, though. Upgrade charges origination fees between 1.85% and 9.99%, and its maximum APR is 35.99%. Borrowers with thin or weak credit profiles should expect to pay on the higher end of those ranges. Discounts for setting up autopay, using loan proceeds for debt consolidation, and opting for a secured loan are available, but the lender doesn\u2019t reveal the details. A $200 bonus is also available for setting up and funding a checking account with Upgrade during your loan application. You can fund your new account with your loan funds.\nUpgrade was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in San Francisco.

In practice, that means it accepts borrowers with credit scores as low as 300. Moreover, students and college graduates with an income can qualify without a credit history.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nLow minimum credit score\nFast funding\nA wide range of loan amounts\nCons\nPotentially high origination fee\nHigh APRs for some borrowers\nFewer loan term options than competitors\nOverview\nIf your credit score is below 580, you don\u2019t have many options to borrow. Loan offers you do receive will be expensive, with high origination fees and APRs.\nUpstart\u2019s minimum required credit score of 300 is the lowest of the 59 lenders in our database. It will even consider borrowers without a credit score. Despite this flexibility, its rates, fees, and terms are not prohibitively expensive.\nUpstart works with various lenders with\ndifferent underwriting requirements\n, so borrowers with weaker or stronger credit profiles will match with lenders offering rates and terms that fit. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $75,000, covering a range of borrower needs.\nRates start at 6.70% and max out at 35.99%, the industry's de facto APR cap. (That rate cap is linked to the Military Lending Act, which limits APRs on consumer loans for military service members at 36%.)\nUpstart has made available nearly $40 billion in credit of various types through its platform, including personal loans, since it was founded in 2012.

The bank\u2019s maximum advertised APR is low, and existing Citibank customers are eligible for same-day funding. Plus, you can get in-person help with your application at a local branch.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nLow maximum APR\nNo fees of any kind\nRepayment terms up to 5 years\nHigh J.D. Power ranking\nCons\nHigh starting APRs\nLower loan limits than other lenders\nMust be an existing Citibank customer\nOverview\nCitibank doesn\u2019t charge\norigination fees\nor late fees, and its maximum advertised APR is low, keeping borrowing costs down. The autopay discount of 0.50% is higher than many other lenders offer (0.25% is typical). Citigold and Citi Priority customers can get an additional 0.25% rate discount.\nAnother perk for existing customers is same-day funding, which is sent directly to their Citibank account.\u00a0 In the 2024 J.D. Power Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study, Citibank ranked third.\nWith all that in its favor, it\u2019s disappointing that Citibank now limits personal loan applications to existing customers.\nCitibank, founded in 1812, is the third-largest U.S. bank, with total assets exceeding $1.83 trillion, as of September 2025.\nIt operates 648 branches in the U.S. In a $70 billion deal, Citicorp and Travelers Group merged in 1998 to form Citigroup.\nAdditional Details\nMinimum Credit Score\nNo stated minimum\nOrigination Fees\nNone\nMembership Requirement\nNone; existing customers can borrow up to $50,000\nAvailable Discounts\n0.50% autopay; 0.25% for Citigold and Citi Priority customers\nRead the Full\nCitibank Personal Loans Review\nBest for Small Loan Amounts\n:\nLake Michigan Credit Union\nInvestopedia's Rating\n3.7\nout of 5 stars\nAPR Range:\n9.99% - 18.00%\nLoan Amount:\n$250 - $25,000\nLoan Terms:\n1 month - 60 months\nCheck Rates\n(opens in a new tab)\nOn Investopedia\nWhy We Chose It\nA local credit union is your best bet for an affordable personal loan. This is especially true if you want a loan under $1,000. We chose Lake Michigan Credit Union as the Best for Small Loan Amounts because its minimum of $250 is the lowest in our database of 59 lenders, but plenty of credit unions have minimums of $300 or $500.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nSmall loan amounts\nNo origination fees\nCredit life and disability insurance available\nOption to skip a monthly payment for $25\nCons\nNo pre-qualification\nMembership required\nOverview\nWe chose LMCU as Best for Small Loans because of its $250 minimum. However, many credit unions offer loans under $1,000 and even under $500, so you have plenty of options.\nYou won\u2019t pay an origination fee on a loan from LMCU. Because it is a federal credit union, you won\u2019t pay more than 18% interest. If something unexpected happens, you can skip a monthly payment (for a $25 fee), up to twice a year. The minimum credit score of 650 means LMCU loans are available to\npeople with \u201cfair\u201d credit\n. You can also apply with a co-borrower.\nUnfortunately, LMCU does not offer pre-qualification; you must complete an application to see what rates and terms you are approved for. That means a slight negative hit to your credit score.\nAnd because it\u2019s a credit union, you need to become a member to borrow. If you don\u2019t meet LMCU\u2019s affiliate or regional qualifications, you can join by donating $5 to the ALS Foundation.\nLMCU was founded in 1933. Today, it has over $14 billion in assets and more than 600,000 members.

Borrowers can choose from a wide range of loan amounts and terms and rates start at 8.74% and won\u2019t exceed 18%. Plus, there are no origination fees. If you\u2019re borrowing at least $30,000 for a home improvement, you can take up to 180 months to pay it off. Just be aware that late payments will result in a $29 late payment fee.\nNavy Federal earned the second-highest score in the 2024 J.D. Power Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study and a Combined Consumer Review rating of 4.5 (out of 5).\nThis rating, developed by Investopedia researchers, is an aggregate of consumer review ratings on two third-party review sites: Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau.\nUnfortunately, only military service members, Department of Defense personnel, and their families can join. Another knock against Navy Federal is that it does not offer\npre-qualification\n; you\u2019ll need to complete a loan application to learn the rates and terms you qualify for. Moreover, you\u2019ll need to join the credit union before you can begin an application.\nNavy Federal, founded in 1933 and headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, is the nation\u2019s largest credit union.\nAdditional Details\nMinimum Credit Score\nNot disclosed\nOrigination Fees\nNone\nMembership Requirement\nYes\nAvailable Discounts\nNone\nRead the Full\nNavy Federal Personal Loans Review\nBest Credit Union\n:\nPatelco Credit Union\nInvestopedia's Rating\n4.6\nout of 5 stars\nAPR Range:\n9.30% - 17.90%\nLoan Amount:\n$300 - $100,000\nLoan Terms:\n6 months - 84 months\nCheck Rates\n(opens in a new tab)\nOn Investopedia\nWhy We Chose It\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned that a local credit union should be your first stop when shopping for a personal loan.

Still, its broad range of personal loan options, competitive rates, customer support tools and resources, and enticing rate discounts are worth noticing. You can borrow as little as $300 and as much as $100,000. Repayment terms range from 6 months to 84 months. Patelco even offers\ncredit builder loans\nif you want to boost your credit score.\nPatelco offers two rate discounts. The first is a customer loyalty discount of 0.10% for members with several accounts that meet deposit or loan minimums. The second, a 0.50% reduction, rewards borrowers who make on-time payments for 12 consecutive months. This one can be earned three times for a rate discount of up to 1.50%. Patelco also offers payment protection insurance and several hardship programs if borrowers need more time to make a payment.\nMembership is easy.

Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been researching and evaluating personal loan lenders since 2019.\nCurrent Average Personal Loan Interest Rates\nInvestopedia calculates\naverage monthly personal interest rates\nby taking a four-week average of weekly personal loan rate data for 17 major lenders that offer personal loans. Advertised personal loan rates on lender websites are stated as a range of annual percentage rates (APRs) that lenders offer to borrowers of all credit quality ranges on their websites.\nPersonal Loan APRs by Credit Score\nBorrower credit score is a key factor in personal loan interest rates.\nCredit Tier\nAverage APR April 2025\nAverage APR May 2025\nM-O-M Change % Pts\nExcellent\n20.42%\n19.02%\n-1.40%\nGood\n25.52%\n26.07%\n0.55%\nFair\n29.69%\n30.04%\n0.35%\nPoor\n30.72%\n30.62%\n-0.10%\nAll Tiers\n24.69%\n22.95%\n-1.74%\nHow Does a Personal Loan Work?\nA\npersonal loan\nis a type of\ninstallment loan\nwhere borrowers receive a lump sum and then repay it in increments over a period of time. Personal loan amounts can range from a few hundred dollars to $100,000. The repayment terms may also vary: some can be paid off in a few months while others may be repaid over years.\nPersonal loans can be unsecured or secured, although most are unsecured.\nSecured loans\nrequire the borrower to provide\ncollateral\nto back the loan, while unsecured loans don\u2019t. Since unsecured loans don\u2019t require collateral, lenders typically determine the terms of your loan by evaluating your creditworthiness\u2014the higher your\ncredit score\n, the more likely you are to receive favorable terms, including a lower APR.\u00a0 Lenders may also examine your annual income, credit history, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.\nTypically, the interest rate, or\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR)\n, on personal loans is fixed, which means it doesn\u2019t fluctuate.\nTip\nIf your credit score is low or your credit history is thin, you may not think you're eligible for a personal loan. However, some lenders specialize in loans for people with challenging credit. Learn more about them:\nBest Personal Loans for Bad Credit\nand\nBest Emergency Loans for Bad Credit\n.\nWho Is a Personal Loan Loan Good For?\nA personal loan is best for people who want flexibility in how they use their funds, prefer a lump-sum payment, and have a strong credit score.\nUnlike other types of debt, like an\nauto loan\nor\nmortgage\n, a personal loan offers versatility: You can use the funds to pay off medical expenses, finance moving costs, purchase a big-ticket item, and more.\nWhile personal loans typically offer lower APRs than credit cards, borrowers need a solid credit score when applying for a personal loan to qualify for the best rates. Therefore, they may be a budget-friendly lending option for those who have strong credit scores and histories.\nCommon Personal Loan Terms\nAnnual percentage rate (APR)\n: This is the yearly interest rate, including fees like origination fees, and is represented as a percentage. The APR will be same as the interest rate unless the lender charges additional fees.\nOrigination fee\n: This is a one-time fee that a lender may charge for processing your loan application.\nOrigination fees\nare represented as a percentage of the total loan amount, typically ranging from 1% to 8%. They are included in the APR. Since these are upfront fees are often deducted before you begin making payments, subtract the origination fee from the total loan amount to calculate the funds you\u2019ll receive.\nCredit Score\n: A\ncredit score\nis a three-digit number that indicates a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. Credit scores are calculated by evaluating factors like someone\u2019s payment history, length of credit history, and\ncredit utilization\n. Lenders will look at a borrower\u2019s credit score to approve someone for a loan and determine the terms of the loan. A higher credit score generally means that a borrower will receive better terms on a loan.\nPre-qualification\n: Some lenders offer borrowers the option of seeing if they qualify for a loan before applying. The lender will run a\nsoft credit check\n, an inquiry into your credit report that doesn\u2019t affect your credit score. They may require certain information like your name, address, and income. You will then be denied or given possible loan offers. However,\npre-qualification\ndoes not guarantee approval. You'll still need to complete the whole process of applying for a personal loan to receive funding.\nPros & Cons of Personal Loans\nPros\nFlexibility when using funds\nLower APRs than credit cards\nUnsecured personal loans don\u2019t require collateral\nFixed interest rates\nCons\nStrong credit required for lower APRs\nOrigination fees and late fees\nLack of continued access to credit\nPros Explained\nFlexibility when using funds\n: With personal loans, borrowers can generally use the funds as they see fit. That means you could use a personal loan to help finance a wedding, pay off moving expenses, and\nconsolidate your debt\n. A debt consolidation personal loan lets you wrap multiple debt payments into one monthly payment. To make sure you\u2019re actually saving money on interest, pay close attention to the interest rates and loan terms of the new loan.\nTypically offer lower APRs than credit cards\n: Personal loans can charge much lower APRs than credit cards, though you'll need a strong credit score to be eligible for the best rates.\nUnsecured personal loans don\u2019t require collateral\n: Many personal loans are unsecured, so you won\u2019t have to put up collateral, which can be seized if you default on the loan. However, if you default on an unsecured loan, your account can be sent to collections, which can still negatively impact your credit score.\nInterest rates are fixed\n: Many personal loans offer fixed interest rates and fixed payments, so you don\u2019t need to worry about how\ninterest rate changes\ninfluence your monthly payments once you\u2019ve taken out a loan.\nCons Explained\nNeed a good credit score to qualify for lower APRs\n: To get the best terms on a personal loan, you\u2019ll probably want a FICO credit score that\u2019s considered \u201cgood\u201d or better\u2014that means having a score of more than 670.\nIf you have a lower credit score, you may still qualify but could receive worse terms.\nMay have origination fees and late fees\n: Before you sign up for a personal loan, pay careful attention to any fees the lender charges. Origination fees are upfront fees that are subtracted from your loan, late fees can be incurred if you fail to make on-time payments, and if you pay off your loan early, you may be on the hook for a prepayment penalty.\nLack of continued access to credit\n: While receiving a lump sum is useful to some, if\u00a0you prefer having access to an open\nline of credit\nthat allows you to borrow money as needed, you may consider opting for a credit card or something like a\nhome equity line of credit (HELOC)\nover a personal loan.\nAlternatives to Personal Loans\nA personal loan\u2014available from many online lenders, banks, and credit unions that offer personal loans\u2014can help you cover an emergency expense, make a home improvement, or help you consolidate higher-cost debt, but it\u2019s not your only choice.\nCredit Cards\nWith\ncredit cards\n, cardholders receive a revolving line of credit up to a fixed credit limit and then make monthly payments to pay down their debt. Like personal loans, credit cards allow you to use money flexibly but often charge higher APRs. And since credit cards have variable APRs, the interest rate (plus fees) may fluctuate with changes in the\nfederal funds rate\n.\nSome credit cards offer rewards for the money you spend. Depending on the card, you may receive cash-back, rewards points, or miles on your everyday spending. However, if you\u2019re not diligent about paying off your balance on time and in full every month, the interest you pay on your credit card debt will exceed the value of the rewards you earn.\nWarning\nCredit cards may not be right for everyone. Interest rates are high, especially if your credit score is fair or poor. If you carry a balance from month to month, interest costs can get expensive.\nIn contrast, personal loans generally have fixed interest rates, so your monthly payment is fixed. And\nunlike credit cards\n, personal loans provide borrowers with a lump-sum\u2014if you need additional money, you\u2019d have to apply for another loan.\nGenerally, credit cards are a better choice if you\u2019re looking to finance everyday expenses, while a personal loan is a better choice if you want a lump-sum payment for debt consolidation or paying off a major expense. Whether you opt for a credit card or a personal loan, they\u2019re both types of debt. Failing to make your payments in full and on time will hurt your credit score.\nHome Equity Loans\nA\nhome equity loan\nis a type of mortgage loan that allows you to borrow against the equity you have in your home. Like personal loans, home equity loans provide a lump sum of cash and have fixed interest rates and terms, meaning borrowers have fixed monthly payments.\nWhile home equity loans generally offer lower APRs than credit cards and personal loans, they can be risky. Since your home equity is considered collateral with a home equity loan, you could be at\nrisk of foreclosure\nif you can\u2019t pay it off. Plus, if the value of your home declines, you may end up paying more than your home is worth.\nOne upside of a home equity loan is that your interest payments can be tax-deductible if you use the funds to \u201cbuy, build, or substantially improve the residence,\u201d according to the IRS.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWho Is the Best Lender for a Personal Loan?\nAccording to our research,\nLightStream\nis the best personal loan lender, based on its combination of competitive rates, large loan amounts, and wide range of repayment terms.\nIf you're looking to borrow from a traditional bank, our choice is\nCitibank\n. It offers a low maximum APR and same-day funding for Citibank account holders. If you live near a Citibank branch, you can get in-person assistance with your application.\nWhat Credit Score Is Needed for a Personal Loan?\nThe average personal loan borrower had a credit score of 685 during the final quarter of 2022, according to the Federal Reserve.\nHowever, this can vary quite a bit; some lenders, such as Upstart, have no minimum credit score requirement. Others require a credit score over 700. Banks and credit unions tend to have higher\ncredit score requirements\n. Fintech lenders generally accept lower credit scores.\nHow Much Would a $5,000 Personal Loan Cost per Month?\nThe monthly cost of a personal loan, of whatever amount, will depend on the loan amount, the loan term (or the number of monthly payments), and the interest rate. The easiest way to calculate a monthly payment is to use a\npersonal loan calculator\n. A $5,000 loan, with no origination fees and repaid over 24 months (or two years), with an interest rate of 12.33% (the current average rate charged on two-year personal loans, according to the Federal Reserve) would result in a monthly payment of $236.14.\nTotal interest cost would be $667.33.\nShould You Get a Personal Loan From a Bank or a Credit Union?\nBased on our analysis of rates, terms, customer experience, and other factors, we encourage borrowers to check with a credit union while gathering loan offers. Credit unions generally offer better rates to a broader range of credit profiles than traditional banks or fintechs.\nHowever, credit unions may not be as convenient as banks or fintechs, due to credit union membership requirements. And few credit unions offer the streamlined application and approval processes that fintechs, and many banks, now offer.\nCompanies We Reviewed\nWe researched and reviewed 59 lenders to find the lenders you see above.

We identified and collected 45 criteria, including APRs, loan amounts and terms, fees, customer experience, and more. Our criteria and ratings are also informed by speaking to hundreds of borrowers about their personal experiences with personal loan lenders and their views on the process. Research and data collection began on July 23 and concluded on October 18, 2024.\nWe organized the 45 criteria into four categories. We then scored and weighted 26 criteria to develop our overall star rating for each lender (1,500 data points in all), using the remaining criteria for background and editorial richness. The categories and their weights for this project are:\nLoan Costs\n(APRs, origination and late fees, autopay discount): 30%\nBorrowing Requirements\n(Secured loans, membership requirement, minimum credit score, and four other factors): 24%\nLender Features\n(Online experience, educational resources, pre-qualification, and seven other features): 24%\nLoan Terms\n(Loan terms and amounts, funding time, approval process): 22%\nTo maintain the integrity of the data following collection and analysis, Investopedia\u2019s compliance team monitors changes to key details, like interest rates and fees.

Understanding options and other derivatives can enhance a trader's profitability.\nUnderstanding Options & Derivatives Trading\nOptions Contracts Explained: Types, How They Work, and Benefits\nUnderstanding Derivatives: A Comprehensive Guide to Their Uses and Benefits\nI Own Some Stock Warrants. How Do I Exercise Them?\nUnderstanding Tax Rules for Call and Put Options in the U.S.\nUnderstanding Securitization: Definition, Benefits, Risks, and Real-Life Example\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs options trading a derivative?\nYes, the simplest derivative investment allows individuals to buy or sell what is known as an option on a security. An option is a contract to buy or sell a specific financial product. Various derivative instruments besides options include swaps, futures, and forward contracts. The investor does not own the underlying asset, but they hope to profit by making bets on the direction of price movements spelled out in the contract.\nLearn More:\nDerivatives 101\nWhat are derivative ETF futures and options?\nSimply put, ETF futures and options are derivative instruments tied to exchange traded funds. Futures represent an agreement to buy or sell shares of an underlying ETF at an agreed-upon price on or before a certain date in the future. Options, in contrast, give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to trade the underlying ETF shares at an agreed-upon price on or before a specified date in the future.\nLearn More:\nETF Futures and Options\nHow big is the derivatives market?\nThe actual size of the derivatives market depends on what a person considers part of the market and so estimates vary widely. The entire derivatives market is, simply put, huge, and top estimates can be more than $1 quadrillion on the high end, based on what is included as a derivative. The larger estimates come from adding up the notional value of all available derivatives contracts. For example, the overall derivatives markets include products including options, warrants, swaps, credit default swaps, futures contracts, and forward contracts, as just a handful of examples. Some analysts argue that such a calculation doesn't reflect reality, in that the notional value of a derivative contract's underlying assets does not represent the actual market value.\nLearn More:\nHow Big Is the Derivatives Market?\nWhat is a forward contract?\nA forward contract is a derivatives instrument that is one of the oldest and most common types of derivative securities, in which counterparties agree to buy (receive) or sell (deliver) an asset at a specified price on a future date. They are used as a form of risk management, in that a forward contract can be used for hedging or speculation. They are quite common in foreign exchange markets as a way for investors to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities from various global currency markets.\nLearn More:\nForward Contracts: The Foundation of All Derivatives\nWhat are ETF futures?\nETF futures are a kind of financial derivatives product built on existing exchange traded funds. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell shares of an underlying ETF at an agreed-upon price on or before a specified date.\nLearn More:\nETF Futures and Options\nKey Terms\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC)\nCboe Options Exchange\nWarrant Coverage\nWarrant Premium\nWeather Derivative\nFreight Derivatives\nTransaction Risk\nCashless Conversion\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC)\nThe Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC) is commonly referred to as Farmer Mac, and was by an act of Congress in 1987 in response to the farm crisis in the United States, which led to thousands of farmers to default on their loans, lose their farms and led to the collapse of many agricultural banks that services the farming industry.\nLearn More\nCboe Options Exchange\nThe Cboe Options Exchange is the world's largest options exchange that was founded in 1973. It was originally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the exchange changed its name in 2017 as part of a rebranding effort by its holding company, CBOE Global Markets, which runs the exchange with contracts focusing on individual equities, indexes, and interest rates.\nLearn More\nWarrant Coverage\nWarrants are similar to options, except that they are issued by a company and dilute overall equity ownership. Warrant coverage is an agreement between a company and shareholders in which the company issues a warrant that is worth some percentage of the dollar amount of their investment. Warrants, also like options, allow investors to acquire shares at an agreed-upon price.\nLearn More\nWarrant Premium\nA warrant premium is the difference between the traded price of a warrant and its minimum value. A warrant's minimum value is the difference between its exercise price and the current traded price of its underlying stock.\nLearn More\nWeather Derivative\nA weather derivative is a financial product that companies or investors can use to hedge risk against weather-related disasters, much like insurance. The seller of a weather derivative agrees to bear the risk of disasters in return for a premium for taking on that risk. If nothing happens before the agreed-upon contract, the seller will profit, but in the event of a weather phenomenon or disaster, the buyer of the derivatives contract will claim the set amount. Various industries such as agriculture or tourism and travel will use these financial products to offset any potential losses from unexpected weather disrupting business.\nLearn More\nFreight Derivatives\nFreight derivatives are financial products that derive their value from various freight agreements and freight rates, such as dry bulk carrying rates, and is used primarily in the shipping and cargo industry to manage the risk of fluctuating levels of freight charges or oil tanker rates changing unexpectedly. The risk management tool has become more in focus as the shipping industry bears the burden of supply-chain shocks and delays as a result of the global pandemic.\nLearn More\nTransaction Risk\nTransaction risk is the risk that an investor or company may take on when currency exchange rate fluctuations may change the value of a foreign transaction after a transaction has been completed but not yet settled, and can also be referred to as exchange rate, or currency risk. Transaction risk takes on greater risk when there is a longer time between when the transaction occurs and when it settles.\nLearn More\nCashless Conversion\nA cashless conversion is when the ownership of some kind of security or asset changes without cash payment by the owner. For example such a conversation may take place if convertible bonds or convertible preferred shares are part of a transaction in which there is a cashless conversion to common stock in the deal. A cashless conversion is typically spelled out in the contract when the deal occurs, and the transfer may happen by an agreed upon trigger event or specific date.\nLearn More\nZero-Day Options Had Their Best Month in May.

Subsidized loans are solely for eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need to help cover the costs of a higher education, while unsubsidized loans are available for eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, though eligibility isn\u2019t based on financial need. PLUS loans are made to graduate or professional students as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. A consolidation loan allows you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into one loan with a sole loan servicer.\nLearn More:\nSubsidized vs. Unsubsidized Student Loans\u2014Which Is Best?\nShould you pay off your student loans early?\nIt depends on your financial circumstances. Since interest may accumulate on your student loans while you\u2019re in school (depending on the type of loan), it may make sense to begin making payments toward your debt before the actual due date kicks in.\nThere are no penalties for making prepayments on either federal or private student loans, so if you are able it can save you some money to start early.\nLearn More:\nManaging Your Student Loans During College\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t pay off your student loan?\nThe first day following a missed student loan payment, your student loan becomes past due (i.e.,\ndelinquent\n) until you either repay the past due amount or make other arrangements with your creditor. Remaining delinquent for 90 days or more will result in your loan servicer reporting the delinquency to the three major national credit bureaus. Following a certain period of delinquency, which varies based on the type of loan, there is also a risk of the loan going into\ndefault\n.\nLearn More:\nStudent Loan Help: Free and Low-Cost Solutions to Out-of-Control Loans\nCan student loans repayments come out of your retirement funds?\nPer the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\n, most employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as a 401(k), are protected from seizure by creditors in nearly all cases.\nHowever, according to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, up to 15% of your Social Security payments can be garnished to repay your federal student loan(s) should you default. Fortunately, the amount garnished cannot reduce your monthly benefit payment below $750.\nLearn More:\nHeading Into Retirement With Student Loans\nKey Terms\nEducation Loan\nFederal Direct Loan Program\nFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)\nFAFSA Award Letter\nDeferment Period\nPLUS Loan\nDirect Consolidation Loan\nStudent Loan Interest Deduction\nEducation Loan\nAn education loan, more commonly known as a student loan, is an amount of money borrowed from a federal or private lender to pay for a higher education. This sum can be used to cover the cost of tuition, textbooks, other school supplies, and basic living expenses so that a student may focus on earning their degree. Generally speaking, federal student loans offer lower interest rates than their private counterparts.\nLearn More\nFederal Direct Loan Program\nThe William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program is a federal student loan program offered by the U.S. Department of Education. The Federal Direct Loan Program is available to eligible postsecondary students and their parents. Direct subsidized loans, direct unsubsidized loans, direct PLUS loans, and direct consolidation loans are all available through this program.\nLearn More\nFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)\nThe Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is an official form that must be filled out in order to receive financial aid from the federal government. To complete the FAFSA, you must provide information about yourself and your financial situation. The FAFSA is available starting Oct. 1 of the year prior to enrollment, and the federal due date is June 30 of the academic year (some colleges and/or states have their own deadlines).\nLearn More\nFAFSA Award Letter\nA FAFSA award letter is provided by the colleges that are listed on your FAFSA form and details the cost of attendance for an academic year and your eligibility for any grants, loans, etc. Most colleges send out award letters alongside their admission offer letters. Although colleges have access to your FAFSA information a day after it\u2019s processed, the timeframes for reviewing your FAFSA information may vary from one university to another.\nLearn More\nDeferment Period\nA deferment period is an amount of time where a borrower isn't required to repay their loan's principal or interest. Deferment periods vary based on the type of loan; student loans can only be deferred for up to three years. Depending on the type of student loan, you may still have to pay down the interest that accrues during the deferment period.\nLearn More\nPLUS Loan\nA PLUS loan is offered to graduate & professional students and the parents of dependent undergraduates. While eligibility isn\u2019t based on financial need, a credit check is required, and borrowers with an adverse credit history won\u2019t be eligible without meeting other criteria.\nThe max amount available to you will be based on your chosen college's cost of attendance minus any financial aid you\u2019ve received.\nLearn More\nDirect Consolidation Loan\nA direct consolidation loan allows you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into just one loan with a sole loan servicer.\nYour consolidated loan will have a fixed interest rate based on the average of the original loans\u2019 interest rates. Consolidating multiple loans can be accomplished at no cost to you and allows you to reduce your number of monthly payments.\nLearn More\nStudent Loan Interest Deduction\nA student loan interest deduction allows you to deduct up to $2,500 of the interest paid on qualified student loans during the tax year. The deduction is only available if you meet certain eligibility criteria, and it\u2019s gradually reduced as your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) reaches its annual limit. This interest deduction is claimed as an adjustment to income, so it don't need to itemized on your income tax returns.\nLearn More\nCongrats on Your Wedding!

This type of economy is often associated with communist nations. The advantages of this approach include better equality and lower unemployment, but there is often a lack of efficiency or innovation in those economies.\nLearn More:\nCommand Economy: Advantages and Disadvantages\nWhat is a market economy?\nA market economy, or free economy, is directed through the laws of supply and demand to set the prices and quantities for most goods and services. Most developed nations are technically mixed economies because they blend free markets with some government interference such as industrial subsidies, licensing, and price fixing.\nLearn More:\nMarket Economy vs. Command Economy: What's the Difference?\nWhat does inflation do to an economy?\nInflation means the rate at which the same goods and services come to cost more. If a person's income doesn't keep up with inflation, it can decrease your purchasing power. It can also lower the value of Treasury bonds. But if some level of inflation is expected, it can drive consumer spending, which drives economic growth.\nLearn More:\nWhen Is Inflation Good for the Economy\nHow stocks help the economy\nWhen the price of a large number of stocks is on the rise, it can lead to higher consumer and business confidence, higher spending on big-ticket items such as cars and houses, and an increase in investors entering the stock market. These factors can all lead to greater economic development of a country.\nLearn More:\nWhat Does the Term 'Invisible Hand' Refer to in an Economy?\nWhat type of economy does the U.S. have?\nThe United States has a mixed economy. It combines elements of a command economy with a market economy. A mixed economy allows for government oversight and regulation to achieve public good while also allowing things like consumer goods and services to be regulated by the laws of supply and demand.\nLearn More:\nIs the United States a Market Economy or a Mixed Economy?\nKey Terms\nEconomy\nMoney\nTrade\nKnowledge Economy\nWealth\nLaw of Supply and Demand\nInflation\nOrganized Labor\nSluggish Economy\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nEconomy\nAn economy encompasses all activity related to the production, consumption, trade, and distribution of available goods and services. The management of those resources is used to satisfy the needs of the people, businesses, organizations, and governments in a specific area.\nLearn More\nMoney\nCurrency, or money, is a generally accepted, recognized, and centralized medium of exchange that market participants use to engage in transactions for goods and services in an economy. Each government has its own money system that is monitored by a central authority.\nLearn More\nTrade\nThe buying, selling, or bartering of goods and services is known as trade. In an economy, a trade takes place between a producer and a consumer, usually in exchange for money. An exchange of goods and services between two countries is international trade.\nLearn More\nKnowledge Economy\nA knowledge economy is a system of consumption and production based on the intangible assets of intellectual capital. It refers to the ability to capitalize on scientific discoveries and academic research, and has come to represent a large component of all economic activity in developed countries.\nLearn More\nWealth\nWealthy is an abundant supply of valuable economic assets or resources owned by a person, company, community, or nation. It can be determined by subtracting debt from the total market value of all physical and intangible assets.\nLearn More\nLaw of Supply and Demand\nThe law of supply and demand is an economic theory based on two separate \"laws\" that explain the interaction between the sellers of a resource and the buyers of that resource. The theory defines the relationship between the price of a given good or product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it. Generally, as the price increases, people are willing to supply more and demand less and vice versa when the price falls.\nLearn More\nInflation\nA decline of the\npurchasing power\nof a specific currency over time is known as inflation. You can see the rate of decline reflected in the increase of an average price level of a\nbasket of selected goods\nand services in an economy over a specified period of time. The rise in the general level of prices, often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.\nLearn More\nOrganized Labor\nAn association of workers united as a single entity, known as organized labor or a union, seek to improve the economic status and working conditions of employees through collective bargaining with management.\nLearn More\nSluggish Economy\nThe colloquial phrase \"sluggish economy\" is not an exact and quantifiable thing. It is derived from an analogy to a slug and refers to an economy in which growth is slow in macroeconomic terms. It can be used to describe an entire economy or a segment of it.\nLearn More\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of a country's overall domestic production and a measure of that country's overall economic health. It is calculated by the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders in a specific time period.\nLearn More\nVisitor Numbers in Las Vegas Plummet, Sparking Worries About US Economic Health\nHow Tariffs are Affecting Job Prospects for the Class of 2025\nWhat Is Dollar Weaponization and How Has It Sped Up De-Dollarization?\nA 2003 Study Found that Black College Grads Had the Same Job Callback Chances as White Convicted Felons\u2014Has Anything Changed?\nUnderstanding Black Friday from an Economist's Viewpoint and Its Impact on You\nExplore Economy\nAll\nEconomics\nGovernment & Policy\nFiscal Policy\nMonetary Policy\nWhat Investors Need to Know About the \"Moron Risk Premium\"\nCould Trump's Tariffs Cause a Worldwide Recession?\nFinancial Services Forum: Definition, Mission, and Accomplishments\nDo U.S. Election Results Influence the Stock Market?\nLehman Moment\nWhat Is a Fed Pivot and Why It Matters in Monetary Policy\nUnderstanding Doom Loops: Causes and Economic Impact Explained\nFed\u2019s Preferred Inflation Gauge Rose More Than Expected in August 2022\nThe U.S. Labor Market\u2019s Post-COVID Recovery in Charts\nBasel IV Explained: Impact on U.S. Banks and Global Finance Reforms\nTop 32 Developed and Developing Countries\nMoney Explained: Essential Properties, Types, and Practical Uses\nWhat Is the Unemployment Rate?\nMarket Economy vs. Command Economy: What's the Difference?\nIs the U.S. a Mixed or Market Economy?

While the company has gone fully remote, its head office is in San Francisco, CA.\nAside from its digital presence, Kraken operates worldwide in over 190 countries, services over 15 million clients, and has established itself as one of the premier cryptocurrency exchanges that offer the best low-fee service.\nKraken offers two platforms: a basic and a pro version. Clients utilizing the basic version can expect to pay the following fees: a fixed 1% trading fee, payment fees, and a spread. Regarding Kraken Pro, clients will pay maker fees between 0.00% and 0.25% and taker fees between 0.08% and 0.40%. The fee will be dependent upon the users' 30-day trading volume. Other fees, such as deposit and address setup fees, come at no extra cost.\nIn addition to its low-fee structure, Kraken offers a unique service that caters to multiple types of clients at various skill levels.\nFor instance, Kraken\u2019s regular platform enables beginning and low-volume traders to start trading and storing their cryptocurrency with a $10 minimum deposit, access to over 540 cryptocurrency assets, an excellent selection of educational and news content, and the ability to create and utilize Kraken's exclusive wallet.\nAdvanced traders who need more sophisticated features should consider Kraken Pro. This platform is designed for traders who need access to advanced order types, charting, and screening capabilities not offered on the original platform.\nThe Kraken Pro's best feature is that it\u2019s free to use. However, Kraken comes with potential drawbacks. While Kraken operates in many countries, the exchange is not available in all 50 U.S. states, such as Washington, New York, and Maine. Furthermore, in many other states, additional restrictions apply to activities such as staking, payment services, funding, and custody. Prospective clients interested in a specific service should check if it is legal in their respective state.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Kraken does not offer any insurance for its users.\nRead the\nfull Kraken review\nBest For Security\n,\nBest for Experienced Traders\n:\nGemini\nGemini\nMinimum deposit:\n$0.00\nMaker fees:\n0.00% to 0.20%\nTaker fees:\n0.03% to 0.40%\nAvailable cryptocurrencies:\n70+\nOpen Account\n(opens in a new tab)\nWhy We Chose It\nBest For Security\nGemini is our top choice for security. The crypto exchange has sound security standards, a commitment to compliance, and third-party audits that ensure its security infrastructure operates at a high level.\nIt\u2019s also one of the few crypto exchanges to offer FDIC and crypto insurance to help further safeguard traders\u2019 accounts.\nBest for Experienced Traders\nIn addition to being our choice for security, Gemini is also our top choice for experienced traders due to its ActiveTrader software. The platform offers experienced users the ability to conduct advanced charting techniques, use advanced\norder types\n, and trade futures and perpetual contracts.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nHighly secure and compliant platform\nAvailable in all 50 U.S. states\nPass-through FDIC insurance for uninvested cash and crypto insurance\nCons\nOffers a low number of cryptocurrencies\nCustomer support only has a request form\nComplex fee structure\nOverview\nGemini was founded in 2014 and is currently headquartered in New York, N.Y.\nDue to its high security standards, Gemini is our choice for users who value security for their cryptocurrency holdings. By default, user accounts are equipped with two-factor authentication. However, Gemini also supports external hardware security keys, such as YubiKey, to secure accounts further.\nGemini holds most customer assets in offshore cold storage, and it works to facilitate easy transfers of assets between the exchange and consumer wallets. Gemini also subjects itself to routine third-party audits and affirms that it has completed SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type 2 exams and its ISO 27001 certification.\nUsers also have the option to store their cryptocurrency in either Gemini\u2019s hot wallet, which is insured, or its cold wallet.\nGemini is also our choice for experienced crypto traders. While high-net-worth individuals can enjoy its high-security standards, they can also appreciate the advanced software it offers with its trademarked tool, ActiveTrader. Even though it offers more than 70 cryptocurrencies, it's still considered a low amount for a major crypto exchange. However, Gemini\u2019s ActiveTrader deserves recognition as a highly advanced platform capable of reaching trade execution speeds of 65 microseconds. Experienced traders also have access to high-risk assets such as perpetual contracts and indices.\nActiveTrader also provides advanced charting and order types that further assist traders in their cryptocurrency ventures.\nGemini does have some drawbacks, most notably its fee structure, as it can be complex. For ActiveTrader, depending on your 30-day trade volume, maker fees can range from 0.00% to 0.20%, while taker fees can range from 0.03% to 0.40%.\nGemini's fee schedule for basic order types, such as instant and recurring orders, will cost clients a 1.49% transaction fee combined with a 1% convenience fee. Limit orders will cost a 1.49% transaction fee, but do not have a convenience fee.\nAdditionally, the type of order you use to execute a trade can affect the total cost. Other fees include a 2.50% fiat transfer fee for using PayPal and a $25 wire transfer fee for fiat withdrawals.\nCustomer support should also be noted, as traders must submit a form to deal with issues like account management and fraud.\nBest for Beginners\n:\nCoinbase\nCoinbase\nMinimum deposit:\n$0.00\nMaker fees:\n0.00% to 0.40%\nTaker fees:\n0.05% to 0.60%\nAvailable cryptocurrencies:\n300+\nOpen Account\n(opens in a new tab)\nOn with Coinbase\nWhy We Chose It\nCoinbase is best for beginners due to its sleek user interface, solid security infrastructure, and a reasonable fee structure that is easy to understand. While Coinbase offers an excellent service for investors new to crypto trading, the company also provides more advanced features, which are nonetheless vital for beginning crypto traders. With Coinbase's comprehensive educational resources, beginners can enhance their skills and utilize Coinbase\u2019s more\nadvanced trading tools\nwhen they are ready, without having to jump to another exchange that caters to more experienced traders.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nExcellent educational and research resources\nReasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency\nAvailable in 172 countries and offers access to web, desktop, and mobile platforms\nCons\nIt may not be a good fit for established traders\nDoes not offer margin or option trading and only provides future trading on select crypto\nMust chat or request a call when contacting customer service\nOverview\nCoinbase is headquartered in San Francisco and was founded in 2012.\nSince its inception as a cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase has become one of the premier leaders in the cryptocurrency space and has done the one thing many crypto exchanges fail to do: cater to beginner crypto investors.\nCryptocurrency is a complicated\nalternative investment\nthat requires careful study by traders. However, Coinbase\u2019s educational resources, which cover basic and advanced trading topics, can help clarify its complexity.\nIn addition, Coinbase offers two charting versions: a basic and an advanced version.\nThe basic version is a simple chart with essential data such as market cap, volume, and other metrics that beginning traders will find valuable.\nHowever, it does not provide any charting tools, which is why Coinbase also has an advanced version.\nThe advanced version offers charting features such as Fibonacci, drawing tools, and projections. Even with advanced trading software, Coinbase may not be a great fit even for experienced traders, as the exchange lacks options and margin trading and only offers futures trading on specific coins.\nInvestors who open an account with Coinbase will see that it has a reasonable fee structure. Its maker fee ranges between 0.00% to 0.40%, and its taker fees are 0.05% to 0.60%.\nAlso, users can trade more than 300 cryptocurrencies while being able to survey over 19,000 digital assets.\nWhile Coinbase provides web, desktop, and mobile platforms, its customer service could be better.\nUsers can contact a service rep through chat or request a call for further assistance.\nRead our full\nCoinbase review\n.\nImportant\nOn May 11, 2025, Coinbase received an email communication from a threat actor notifying the company that internal data and customer information, including names, contact details, partial SSNs, and transaction history, had been accessed after allegedly bribing non-U.S. contractors. The attacker demanded payment to keep the data private. Coinbase says no passwords or funds were compromised and has not paid the ransom.\nBest Mobile App\n,\nBest for Bitcoin\n:\nCrypto.com\nCrypto.com\nMinimum deposit:\n$20\nMaker fees:\n0.08% to 0.25%\nTaker fees:\n0.18% to 0.50%\nAvailable cryptocurrencies:\n400+\nOpen Account\n(opens in a new tab)\nWhy We Chose It\nBest Mobile App\nCrypto.com is our choice for the best mobile app provider due to its major focus on its mobile platform and all that that entails. Crypto traders can buy, sell, use, and trade crypto from the palms of their hands.\nBest for Bitcoin\nCrypto.com is also our choice for Bitcoin traders and investors due to its reasonable fee structure and excellent security infrastructure, which is important to many Bitcoin investors and users. In addition, Crypto.com provides crypto traders with Bitcoin options and futures.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nAllows Bitcoin options and futures\nReasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency\nExcellent mobile platform and debit card program\nCons\nAvailable in fewer than 100 countries\nOnly offers chat service for assistance\nCrypto.com only provides access to a hot wallet\nOverview\nCrypto.com, headquartered in the Central Region of Singapore, boasts an impressive customer base of over 150 million users in more than 100 countries, which isn\u2019t bad for a company that was founded in 2016.\nThe main reason why Crypto.com is so popular goes far beyond its marketing campaigns. It's one of the best crypto exchanges for mobile-first traders and Bitcoin holders.\nMobile users considering Crypto.com can expect a sleek and fully intuitive mobile platform that offers more than convenience. Mobile users have access to more than 400 cryptocurrencies. Depending on the eligible cryptocurrency, users can earn rewards through Crypto.com\u2019s Earn program and its Staking program.\nIn addition to buying, selling, and using cryptocurrency as well as trading derivatives, Crypto.com also provides its mobile users with sophisticated trading features, allowing them to automate their trades. Furthermore, Crypto.com includes access to its Visa debit card, a cryptocurrency-connected card enabling users to easily use their crypto to buy goods and services on the private market.\nAlong with its mobile capabilities, Crypto.com is also best for Bitcoin. The platform offers a wide array of trading, from derivatives to regular long-term investments. The company has a reasonable fee structure, which also applies to its mobile platform. However, depending on their 30-day trade volume, users can expect maker fees to be between 0.08% and 0.25% and taker fees to be between 0.18% and 0.50%. VIP users who hold a tiered amount of\nCronos (CRO)\ncan enjoy additional benefits, such as discounts on maker/taker fees and debit card rewards.\nBitcoin traders will also have access to Bitcoin options and futures, which is an important feature for traders and investors alike.\nBefore users sign up for an account, they should consider the downsides. For instance, Crypto.com is not readily available in many countries. Before committing to opening an account, you should check to see if Crypto.com legally operates in your geographical location. While Crypto.com has an excellent support center to help users resolve issues on their own, it only provides access to a live chat feature for further assistance.\nBest for Altcoins\n:\nBitMart\nSimply Recipes / Alison Bickel.\nBitMart\nMinimum deposit:\nNot publicly disclosed\nMaker fees:\nNot publicly disclosed\nTaker fees:\nNot publicly disclosed\nAvailable cryptocurrencies:\n1,700+\nOpen Account\n(opens in a new tab)\nWhy We Chose It\nBitmart, which offers over 1,700 cryptocurrencies, is our top choice as the best crypto exchange for\naltcoins\n. While the exchange lacks fundamental trading features, it's an excellent plateform to buy cryptocurrency that traders would not usually have to access on other exchanges.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nAccess to over 1,700 cryptocurrencies\nAllows social trading through its copy-trading feature\nBitMart Academy provides excellent educational resources\nCons\nDoes not display its security infrastructure\nIts fee structure is not publicly disclosed without an account\nOnly supports crypto deposits to fund account\nOverview\nBitMart, founded in 2017 and headquartered in New York, N.Y., is our top choice for altcoins due to its accessibility to over 1,700 tradable cryptocurrencies.\nWhile still offering access to the most important coins on the market, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, it provides other coins that may be difficult to find on other exchanges. It's important to note that cryptocurrency poses significant risks even with established digital coins. Smaller, less established coins pose even more risks, with liquidity and market manipulation being a serious concern for crypto holders.\nBitMart also offers its users an interesting way to trade cryptocurrency: copy trading. BitMart users can access statistics for its top traders and see metrics such as\nreturn on investment (ROI)\nfor cryptos they trade, along with their trading history and current trade positions. However, traders should remember that past success does not automatically lead to future gains and should proceed cautiously.\nWhile BitMart has advanced charting capabilities, it\u2019s only for futures trading.\nIn addition, BitMart does not offer some of the order types that certain competitors offer. To date, BitMart only provides two order types: market and limit orders.\nThrough BitMart Academy, the exchange offers excellent educational resources that cover various topics, from basic knowledge to more complex subjects. While it provides a robust selection of crypto, there are some drawbacks. Its fee structure is not publicly disclosed withount an account. Prospective customers will need to create one before they can see BitMart's fee structure. In addition, the only way to fund a new account is to transfer crypto from a wallet or another exchange.\nBitMart claims to have an advanced risk control system with multi-signature technologies and a hybrid hot and cold wallet storage.\nUnlike some competitors, BitMart does not reveal its security infrastructure for users' accounts. For instance, it does not publicly state its security certifications or disclose whether it subjects itself to third-party audits. We can confirm that the company equips users with multifactor authentication.\nRead the full\nBitMart review\n.\nWhy You Should Trust Us\nInvestopedia launched in 1999, and since 2020, we have independently researched 14 cryptocurrency exchanges currently operating in the industry. To choose the best cryptocurrency, we analyzed nearly 450 key data points, including fees, available cryptocurrencies, trading features, security standards, and more, to bring together the list presented to you now. This way, readers interested in opening an account with a crypto exchange can choose the best company that will fit their financial needs and standards.\nHow We Picked the Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Apps\nInvestopedia's in-house team of researchers collected nearly 450 data points through online research of 14 leading cryptocurrency exchange provider websites. To fill in any gaps, our research team reached out to the individual exchanges. In some instances, our researchers did much deeper online research to get the information they needed to complete the data collection. The data collection process spanned from Feb. 7, 2025 to Feb 11, 2025.\nWe then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across four major categories and 29 weighted criteria to find the best cryptocurrency exchange companies. The score for each company\u2019s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria in the following categories:\nTrading Features: 30%\nFees: 28%\nSecurity: 21%\nTransparency: 21%\nThrough our research, Investopedia has provided you with a list of the best crypto exchanges, guided by data-driven analysis and an unbiased and fair approach to helping readers find the best crypto exchange.\nRead our full detailed methodology\n.\nEverything You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency Exchanges\nInvestopedia / Julie Bang\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

A Guide for Yacht Owners\nThe Jones Act\n, formally known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, is one of the most critical pieces of legislation in U.S. maritime law. While you may have heard this term within shipping, boating, or insurance discussions, understanding its wide-reaching implications is essential, especially if you\u2019re a yacht owner or maritime professional with captain/crew exposures.\nBelow, we explore key aspects of the Jones Act to help you understand your obligations, protect your crew, and ensure compliance with this federal law.\nIf you\u2019re a\nyacht owner\nlooking to ensure comprehensive protection for your vessel and crew, we invite you to contact our marine insurance advisors. They can provide a\ntailored yacht insurance\nquote with crew coverage, ensuring you have the proper protection.\nWhat Is the Jones Act?\nThe Jones Act is a federal law designed to protect U.S.-flagged vessels, their operators, and their crews. It governs coastwise trade and establishes specific requirements for ships operating between U.S. ports or conducting domestic trade. It was enacted by the U.S. Congress to stimulate the shipping industry in the wake of World War I.\nHere are some basic principles of the law:\nU.S.-built ships must transport goods or passengers between U.S. ports.\nCompanies operating under the Jones Act must employ U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\nThe Act prioritizes the interests of the American Merchant Marine and national security in a global shipping industry.\nFor yacht owners, one of the most critical aspects of the Jones Act is its focus on safety and working conditions for maritime workers. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how this legislation can impact your responsibilities as a yacht owner.\n1. Captain/Crew Protections\nThe Jones Act provides workers with necessary legal rights, including your yacht\u2019s captain and crew. If a crew member sustains injuries while working on your vessel, they have the right to file claims for compensation. These claims often include\ndamages for medical expenses\n, lost wages, and even pain and suffering.\nIf your captain or crew members feel unsupported, their dissatisfaction could escalate into legal claims. Protecting your crew isn\u2019t just about compliance\u2014it\u2019s about preserving harmony and professionalism aboard your vessel.\nKey Tip:\nMake sure your insurance policy provides comprehensive captain/crew coverage to meet these obligations.\n2. Liability and Negligence\nUnder the Jones Act, yacht owners can be held responsible for injuries caused by negligence or unsafe conditions on board. This means it\u2019s your responsibility to:\nEnsure proper safety measures are in place.\nConduct routine inspections for potential hazards.\nMaintain your vessel\u2019s overall seaworthiness.\nFailing to operate a safe and secure yacht puts your crew at risk and exposes you to expensive legal claims.\nInsurance Tip:\nMany yacht insurance policies offer liability protections to reduce financial risks from negligence claims. Speak to a marine insurance professional to ensure your yacht\u2019s policy includes this crucial coverage.\n3. Maintenance and Cure\nOne of the essential provisions of the Jones Act is the requirement to provide \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d for injured crew members.\nMaintenance\ncovers the crew member\u2019s daily living expenses while recovering.\nCure\npays for their medical treatment until they reach maximum medical improvement (MMI).\nThis obligation applies regardless of fault, so even if the crew member\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t caused by negligence, as a yacht owner, you\u2019re still responsible. Coverage for maintenance and cure claims helps ensure your yacht operation remains financially sustainable in the event of crew injuries.\n4. Obligation to Provide Captain/Crew Coverage\nProviding comprehensive insurance coverage for your captain and crew isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s a legal and moral obligation.\nThis coverage should include protection for:\nInjury due to negligence\nClaims about safety in the work environment\nClaims for lost wages, pain and suffering, or disability\nMaintenance and cure obligations\nThird-party passenger liability, if applicable\nBy ensuring proper insurance coverage, you safeguard your crew\u2019s well-being and protect your financial interests.\nProactive Measure:\nConsult an experienced marine insurance provider to create a policy tailored to your yacht\u2019s unique needs.\n5. Jones Act Requirements for Vessels\nWhile the Jones Act primarily applies to\ncommercial vessels\n, its focus on crew protections and overall safety extends to yacht owners with captain and crew exposures.\nAdditionally, the law emphasizes adherence to coastwise laws, such as hiring U.S. citizens or permanent residents as crew members. Special cases like transporting goods or docking in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, or along coastlines may invoke specific Jones Act rules.\nYacht owners must take these regulations seriously to avoid non-compliance.\n6. Seaworthiness Requirement\nThe Jones Act includes an implied warranty of seaworthiness, meaning that as a yacht owner, you are obligated to ensure that your vessel is reasonably fit for its intended use. This includes keeping the vessel safe for the captain/crew to work on.\nIf a captain/crew member is injured due to the vessel\u2019s unseaworthiness, they may have grounds to file a negligence claim for which the yacht owner would be liable. In some instances, a judgment could be placed against the vessel itself.\n7. Economic and Security Implications\nThe Jones Act is a central piece of legislation for protecting the rights and safety of U.S. maritime workers, including your yacht\u2019s captain/crew. The Act maintains a robust and regulated maritime workforce, thus supporting the domestic maritime industry overall. Ensuring compliance and understanding your responsibilities under the Jones Act helps you provide a safe and secure environment for your captain/crew while minimizing potential liabilities.\n8. Consequences of Not Providing Coverage\nFailing to meet your obligations as stipulated under the Jones Act can result in:\nCostly lawsuits from crew members seeking compensation.\nPersonal liability, with significant out-of-pocket expenses.\nConsequences that may financially jeopardize your vessel\u2019s operation.\nBy understanding your responsibilities and securing robust insurance coverage, you can avoid these penalties while fostering trust and security among your crew.\nSecure Your Vessel\u2019s Future\nInterested in learning more about how the Jones Act applies to your yacht?

It also supports national security by safeguarding domestic shipping and strengthening the U.S. merchant fleet.\nIs the Jones Act Applicable in Puerto Rico?\nYes, the law applies to Puerto Rico, restricting non-U.S.-flagged ships or foreign-flag vessels from transporting goods between U.S. and Puerto Rican ports.\nCan the Jones Act Be Waived?\nA waiver of the Jones Act can be granted during national emergencies or times of war, but these waivers are temporary and subject to conditions set by Homeland Security. Requests for waivers of specific provisions of the Act are reviewed by the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) on a case-by-case basis.\nWhy Is the Jones Act Controversial?\nCritics argue that the Act increases shipping costs by requiring goods to be transported on U.S.-owned and operated vessels, limiting competition from foreign ships in the U.S. economy. However, supporters view it as vital for protecting national security and the U.S. maritime industry.\nYou might also like\nUpgrading Your Vessel?

From the marshy Everglades to the tarpon-rich waters near Boca Grande, it\u2019s a boater\u2019s paradise. Join the ranks of those discovering the restorative nature of boat life.\nHere is everything you need to know about owning a boat in Florida.\nBasic Boat Safety Tips\nThe number one most important element to consider when purchasing a boat in Florida is the boating prowess of the owner. That\u2019s right: before you consider engines, hulls, power poles, or any navigational equipment, be honest about your experience level and your commitment to the craft. Purchase a boat you are comfortable captaining. A vessel that is too large, or that demands more than your training level, may leave you sitting on the shore, uncertain. Research the different types of boats thoroughly and select one that you feel confident driving.\nHaving a high level of confidence regarding the craft you captain is the most basic of basic boat safety tips. The next \u2018must have\u2019 element for every boat owner is the\nboat safety kit\n, which should always remain aboard.\nJust as a Florida homeowner is advised to keep a hurricane preparedness kit just in case, so too must the Florida boat owner have a selection of items that help in the event of an accident or loss of power.\nCommon safety kit items\nFlashlight (and batteries)\n\u2013 Should your vessel break down in the nighttime hours, you\u2019ll be glad to have the illumination.\nEmergency radio\n\u2013 We\u2019ve all been in situations without a phone charger when we really need it. The emergency radio is there even if your cell phone isn\u2019t \u2013 a link between you and those on shore.\nMirror for signaling and whistle for alerting\n\u2013 Hold a mirror up to the sun, and you can deflect that sunlight far away. Even if your electronic equipment fails, that signal can be seen for miles. A whistle is a simple object that can help to alert others of your presence and need for help.\nProperly prepared first aid kit\n\u2013 There are many different types of first aid kits. Compile your own or purchase a kit specifically packed for Florida boaters. Inside, you\u2019ll find the usual bandages, ointments, etc. We recommend adding sunscreen to the mix (that Florida sun can be brutal, and if you\u2019re stranded, you\u2019ll be glad to have it).\nFire extinguisher and garbage bags\n\u2013 The need for the fire extinguisher is apparent, but garbage bags? \u2013 Yes, they are a worthy addition to the Florida boater safety kit. Use garbage bags as ponchos if it rains or to help conserve heat in cold weather.\nLife jackets\n\u2013 There needs to be one\nlife jacket\nfor every person aboard, regardless of age, even if they are expert swimmers. They should be approved by the U.S. Coast Guard.\nDuct tape, buckets, and ropes\n\u2013 Duct tape might not fix everything, but it can plug a small leak and give you enough time to get your craft back to shore. A simple bucket plays an important role if you need to bail out. And ropes are a must on any craft, at least to tie up to docks and rescue an overboard passenger.\nNow that you have the items necessary to make up a Florida boat safety kit, it\u2019s time to educate yourself regarding active, in-the-moment boat safety practices. Hopefully, if you follow the guidance of your boating safety class, you will never need the safety kit at all.\nRecommended Boating Safety Courses\nDid you know that you are\nrequired to take a boat safety course\n? If you are operating a motorized boat of more than 10 horsepower and were born during or after 1988, you are required to do so \u2013 an important part of keeping our waterways safe.\nLook for a course that is Florida-approved; different options exist, including online selections. We suggest this one from\nBoat Ed\n. You can also peruse the list curated by the\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\nfor a solid list of options.\nAfter you\u2019ve aced your Florida boating safety course, make sure you know what to do if your boat breaks down or is involved in an accident. Knowledge gives peace of mind\u2013that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled this boating accident and breakdown guide for a quick snapshot regarding what to do if your Florida boat runs into trouble.\nBoating Accident and Breakdown Guide\nShould a boating accident or breakdown occur, do an immediate check of everyone aboard for injury and to see what medical attention, if any, is needed. Break out the Florida boat first aid kit and tend to any wounds. Then, call for help using your cell phone or the emergency radio aboard.\nWhat to do when involved in a boating accident\nDocument\nthe moment as much as possible. In the frenzy of stress that always accompanies a boating accident, major details can be lost. Take pictures of any damage and, instead of writing things down, you can dictate what happened and save the recording in your phone.\nDetermine if the U.S. Coast Guard should be notified\n.\nCall your marine insurance agent\nand let them know what has happened. Hopefully, you\u2019ve opted for comprehensive insurance protection that has you, your passengers, and your beloved boat covered.\nWhat to do in the event of a breakdown\nTry to move your craft out of the way\n, if possible, if you are on a heavily-traveled waterway. This could save your boat from a collision.\nCall the nearest harbor master,\nor break out the emergency radio and call for help. Different tow services exist to help boaters who are stranded, or the Coast Guard may come to your aid if appropriate.\nWhere to store your boat\nIt\u2019s important to know what to do\non\nthe water, but how are you protecting your boat when you\u2019re\nnot\nexploring the Florida waterways? There are several options available to you.\nStoring your boat in Florida is quite easy. You could leave it outside your residence\u2013keeping the vessel nearby and avoiding marina fees There are some drawbacks to this commonsense approach, however.\nExposing your craft to the elements\nis a surefire way for it to deteriorate more quickly. A pervasive example of this is upholstery. Even the most watertight boat cushions are going to eventually disintegrate, and the more you expose a boat to the elements, the quicker this will occur. You could keep your boat in the garage, of course, but the vessel will take up most of that valuable storage and parking space.\nLift storage\nPerhaps you have a lift outside your home, ready for your boat to be perched and lowered. This is a solid Florida boat storage selection, but make sure that if a hurricane or tropical storm looms, you\u2019ve taken the necessary precautions to keep that on-site boat secured.\nMarina storage\nStorage at a marina is another viable way to keep your boat safe and at the ready for future voyages. Often, marinas will offer security details\u2013but you should still never keep expensive equipment aboard when storing your boat.\nFor those who don\u2019t live on the water, or who don\u2019t want to keep a boat on their property, a marina can be a wonderful choice. Before you select one, make sure to thoroughly understand their\nrules and regulations\n, especially how easy (or difficult) it will be to access your craft whenever you\u2019d like.\nDry stack storage\nIn dry stacking, boats are placed on racks, often indoors and away from the elements. To retrieve your boat, you\u2019ll need to call the storage facility ahead of time and have it lowered and prepared to move safely to your trailer via forklift. This storage option is attractive to those who boat rarely or don\u2019t reside in Florida permanently.\nBoatyard storage\nBoatyard storage is a hybrid Florida boat storage option that combines dry stack storage with near-marina storage. In this case, the stacked boats are kept outside but not necessarily on the water. This is less expensive than marina storage and keeps you relatively close to an embarkation point. You\u2019ll need to follow the same call-ahead process you\u2019d use when dry docking.\nNo matter which Florida boat storage mode you select, resist the impulse to keep the vessel in the water for an extended period of time. Salt water is highly corrosive to boats and, for those not in salt water, weather damage can be catastrophic. At the very least, lift the boat out of the water and remove any electronic equipment and valuables after every excursion.\nImportance of marine insurance\nFlorida marine insurance is so absolutely vital. When it comes to everything you need to know to own a boat in this beautiful state, understanding marine insurance ranks near the top of requirements for safe boating.\nMarine insurance is the ultimate protection for your vessel. Consider it a sort of \u2018invisible life jacket\u2019 you carry with you as you navigate the waterways. Before you ever load the fishing gear and cooler, stock the first aid kit, or chart that first Sunshine State boating excursion, you must protect yourself, your passengers, and your vessel from the unexpected. No one can predict the future\u2013but marine insurance can safeguard you against many unexpected troubles.\nThings to consider when purchasing Florida marine insurance\nInsurance cost\ndepends on the type of vessel, the surrounding environment, the contents aboard, and how you\u2019ll use the boat. You will want to consider physical damage coverage and liability while also considering optimal coverages available to you.\nCall an experienced advisor\nto compile a\npersonalized policy\n, as it is easy to miss a vital part of insurance protection. A marine insurance advisor considers multiple elements before ever suggesting a policy.\nIf an accident were to occur\n, would your passengers\u2019 medical care be covered? Who is liable for those injury-related costs? Your marine insurance advisor can help answer these questions and propose solutions.\nPrepare for the worst and hope for the best.\nThat\u2019s what Florida marine insurance is there for\u2013 to protect you and your craft in a worst-case scenario, while allowing you to go on every voyage with the calm that comes from that protection.\nStay Protected with W3 Insurance\nFlorida marine insurance is the ultimate life jacket. Cover your vessel and those aboard, and set off to explore the Sunshine State\u2019s famous waterways. Stay covered with help from W3 Marine Insurance\u2013and bon voyage!

Keep your vessel shipshape by shielding it from the elements and you\u2019ll reap the longevity benefits that come with a well-maintained marine craft.\nUnless you store your vessel indoors in a hurricane-safe storage facility, it\u2019s often difficult to keep it completely safe from the elements.\nThere are different ways to achieve this aim, and it\u2019s helpful to consider each one before making your ultimate boat storage selection. Reduce wear and tear on your boat by selecting the option that\u2019s right for you.\nFirst, let\u2019s answer the obvious question: Why is it important to properly store your boat? In a perfect world, boats would be impervious to the effects of weather or corrosion. You could park your vessel in the driveway and never worry about a tree falling and damaging onboard contents; it would be just fine to tie up to a dock and keep that hull bobbing in the water indefinitely. This is a world where corrosion exists, unfortunately. The threat of potentially violent weather poses a threat as well. Therefore, it is important to have a plan for securing your boat accordingly. How you do that is up to you, but this guide can help you decide.\nSo what are your boat storage Florida options? You can store the boat either in-the-water or out, covered or wide open. But there are more options than you might think. What really wins the blue ribbon for \u2018the best boat storage option\u2019 depends on the type of boat and the storage options that are actually nearby.\nThe answer that is right for one Florida boat owner is different from the answer for another. Here are some highlights of different boat storage modes and different boat storage ideas to consider.\nTypes of boat storage\nIn-water storage\nCaution: extra care necessary.\nLet\u2019s start with the easiest storage option available to everyone: in-the-water storage. If you do not care how long your vessel stays pristine, this is a great option. We suggest that you don\u2019t store your boat this way for any length of time. Your boat will be\nfully exposed\nto water, which can wear away at that shiny gel coat. Should a storm occur, the vessel could also break free of its mooring and float into another person\u2019s backyard waterway. If you absolutely have to leave your boat bobbing in the water, take care to\nsecure it extremely well\nwith lines. Hopefully, you have a plan to take it out and secure a different means of storage as soon as possible.\nAt-home storage\nUnless you plan to\nuse your garage for boat storage only\n, this will not work well. Trailering the boat and keeping it on the side of the house may be an option; if you choose to do that, make sure to take all items off the boat every time you park it and have a secure cover.\nLift storage\nFor those boat owners who use boat lifts, this is a viable means of boat storage. One of the benefits of lift storage is that the boat will be\neasy to launch\n; this may mean that you and your family will use it more often than you might if the vessel were at an offsite location. It takes mere seconds to lower a boat from its lofty lift perch and into the water. Within a minute or two, you and your family are then off on the next watery excursion.\nKeep in mind that when storing your boat on a lift, you must take care to\nproperly secure it in the event of inclement weather\n. A boat that is overrun by storm surge may break free of its tether. The Internet is full of shocking pictures of boats tipped half-in, half-out of the water or nudged into neighboring backyards by strong currents, wind, & tidal surge.\nPlatform lifts and profile lifts\nare two options, and as for cost, a good rule is to expect to pay approximately $1 for every pound that the lift will have to hoist. For the sake of preparedness, this is definitely a time to overestimate your costs.\nOutdoor boatyard\nAn outdoor boatyard is another option. It\u2019s essentially a car lot filled with boats. Covers can be used to offer further protection. Some boatyards are adjacent to marinas, but it will likely cost less to keep your vessel in the nearby boatyard than in the marina itself.\nMarina slips\nMarinas offer a few options for storing your boat. One option is the\nwet slip\n, in which a vessel will securely float in the water. Often, this storage area is covered and offers fair protection from the elements. Still, this is a version of that in-water storage that can lead to corrosion of the paint and other wear-and-tear.\nAnother option is a\nlift slip\n, which is just what it sounds like. The boat is lifted out of the water, which helps prevent the erosion it can suffer in the water.\nHowever, not every marina covers its lifts, meaning that the elements can affect the vessel. This can cause major problems if a storm hits and the boat is not properly secured.\nHigh-and-dry storage\nThis indoor option keeps your vessel out of the sun and surf. This is ideal for those who\ndo not plan to use the boat on a regular basis\n. It is necessary to call ahead and have someone remove your vessel from its perch before you can trailer it to the next destination. This adds another step to the preparation you must do before taking the boat out on the water, so consider whether high-and-dry storage is too much of a hassle.\nStorage costs\nThe cost to store a boat\nwill vary widely\nbased on the type of storage and the location of the facility. The cheapest mode of storage is obviously at-home storage. The most expensive will likely be at a marina, where you often reap the benefits of on-site security along with a convenient way to launch.\nNo matter which way you choose to store a boat, it is\nimportant to properly insure it\n. Though Florida does not require marine insurance for boat owners, electing not to purchase a policy is a huge risk. Many destruction scenarios can happen that involve a vessel, and accidents and property loss are only two. The best course of action is to\nselect a marine insurance advisor\nyou trust to build a personalized policy plan for you.\nExplore the water with confidence\nW3 Insurance protects vessels so that their owners can feel confident exploring the waterways.

Why a Resume of Experience Matters for Yacht Insurance\nDecember 23, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    In\nYacht Insurance\nWhen you are looking to insure pleasure use yachts, the process can sometimes feel complicated. However, one of the most critical factors insurance companies look at isn\u2019t just the boat itself\u2014it\u2019s you. Specifically, underwriters want to understand your history and overall experience as an owner.\nIn the world of yachting, experience is everything. This is especially true when you decide to purchase a vessel that is significantly different from ones you have owned before. For example, if your yacht owner\u2019s history consists of vessels under 60 feet and you are now buying a 75-foot vessel, this \u201cjump in length\u201d is significant. It might require hiring a full-time captain to navigate the yacht.\nPerhaps you are moving from twin-engine fishing boats to a sportfish with quads. This increase in power may cause concern for underwriters, potentially leading to a higher deductible or a \u201cNamed Operator Warranty\u201d on the\nyacht insurance policy\n.\nIn these scenarios, carriers often require a detailed resume of your experience, including any loss/claim history, before providing an insurance quote. But why is this such a significant factor? Let\u2019s dive in.\nRequest a Quote for Yacht Insurance\nUnderstanding the \u201cJump\u201d in Length and Power\nFor any yacht, the size and the power of its engines can significantly affect both its performance and the boating safety of its operation. The length overall of the yacht and the number of engines it has influence several important aspects.\n1. Safety and Stability\nA larger yacht usually requires advanced handling techniques because it is less maneuverable than a smaller boat. Similarly, multiple engines provide more power but introduce different handling characteristics, especially in rough waters.\n2. Performance Expectations\nLarger yachts with more powerful engines travel faster and cover greater distances. However, this comes with increased risk. A jump in length or power changes how the vessel behaves, and without proper experience, a yachter may struggle to control it within their navigation limits.\n3. Wear and Tear\nLarger yachts undergo greater stresses, which affect durability. Marine insurance providers need to understand this to evaluate risks accurately and adjust premiums or coverage options.\n4. Operational Complexity\nManaging a yacht\nwith increased length or multiple engines is far more complex than handling a smaller, single-engine yacht. The operation of additional engines requires a greater understanding of engine synchronization and fuel management, especially in an emergency.\nWhy Insurance Carriers Need a Resume of Experience Upfront\nProviding a boating resume isn\u2019t just paperwork; it\u2019s about securing the right insurance protection for your specific needs.\nComprehensive Risk Assessment\nA yacht\u2019s size and power are directly tied to the risks an insurer needs to account for. The larger and more powerful the yacht, the higher the potential for property damage or bodily injury in an accident. By providing a resume upfront, insurance carriers can assess the operator\u2019s experience with the yacht\u2019s specifications to determine if they can handle the associated risks. This proactive risk management approach enables a thorough evaluation from the outset.\nEnhanced Accuracy and Efficiency\nSubmitting a resume upfront ensures that all relevant details about the yacht owner\u2019s experience are available early in the process. This minimizes the risk of discrepancies and provides consistent information. It also streamlines the decision-making process regarding insurance solutions, leading to faster processing times and quicker application approval.\nHandling and Maintenance Knowledge\nHandling a larger yacht with multiple engines requires specific skills. Whether it\u2019s docking, navigating tight spots, or dealing with rough waters, these skills need to be built up over time. Insurance companies want to ensure that the yacht operator has experience with these nuances. A resume of experience that demonstrates a history of safe operation helps reassure insurers that the yacht is in capable hands.\nMoreover,\nregular maintenance of larger yachts\nis crucial. Insurance carriers want to know that the yacht owner is proactive about maintaining the yacht properly, as this significantly affects the risk of mechanical failure or accidents.\nCustomized Coverage\nWith larger yachts or those with more complex systems, a generic policy\u2014or relying on standard homeowners endorsements\u2014will not provide the necessary coverage. A resume of experience helps insurers craft a policy that offers the right\nyacht insurance coverage\n.\nWhen we look at your experience, we can better structure the policy to address:\nHull Coverage:\nProtection for physical damage to your vessel\nAgreed Value vs. Actual Cash Value:\nDetermining whether your policy covers the agreed value (the insured amount decided at the start) or the actual cash value (which factors in depreciation)\nLiability Coverage:\nEssential protection and indemnity (P&I) for third-party liabilities, including bodily injury and property damage\nMedical Payments:\nCoverage for necessary medical expenses for you or your passengers\nUninsured Boater:\nProtection if you are hit by someone who lacks proper coverage\nPersonal Property and Personal Effects:\nProtecting your belongings on board, separate from the vessel itself\nWreck Removal:\nCovering the cost to remove your vessel if it sinks or blocks a waterway\nJones Act:\nCoverage for crew members\nif you employ a captain or crew\nLay-up:\nDefining periods when the boat is out of commission, which can affect premiums\nUnderstanding these coverage options helps you answer the question, \u201cWhat kind of insurance do you need for a yacht?\u201d versus a smaller boat.\nRequest a Quote for Yacht Insurance\nYachtsman Education and Experience\nYachtsman education, certifications such as Merchant Marine, Captains License, USCG Auxiliary, or United States Power Squadron courses, and hands-on experience play a vital role in how an insurer assesses risk. Underwriters prefer operators with a proven track record. By detailing your certifications and boating courses, you can improve your chances of receiving comprehensive insurance solutions at the most competitive terms and premiums.\nDemonstrating a commitment to boating safety and continuous learning\u2014such as staying up to date on navigation limits and new technologies\u2014builds trust. This transparency can positively influence the terms of your policy, offering you greater peace of mind.\nBuilding Trust and Credibility\nProviding a resume upfront demonstrates transparency and a willingness to share comprehensive information. This builds trust with the underwriters and shows that the yacht owner is serious about the application process. It reassures insurance carriers that the owner is committed to safe and knowledgeable yachting practices, which can positively influence the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.\nAdditional Considerations for Yacht Owners\nThe Role of Technology in Modern Yachting\nModern yachts are equipped with advanced technology that can enhance safety and performance, but also add to the complexity of operation. A detailed resume of experience should highlight any training or experience the yacht owner has with these technologies. This can further reassure insurance carriers that the owner is well-prepared to handle the sophisticated systems onboard.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nLarger yachts and those with multiple engines can have a greater environmental impact. Responsible yacht ownership includes understanding and mitigating this impact. Demonstrating a commitment to environmental stewardship can be a positive factor when seeking insurance coverage.\nThe Importance of Continuous Learning\nThe world of yachting is constantly evolving. Continuous learning is essential for staying up to date and ensuring safe, responsible yacht operation. Including a history of continuous learning on your resume of experience can demonstrate to insurers that you are committed to maintaining and enhancing your skills over time.\nThe Role of Professional Networks\nBeing part of professional yachting networks or associations can provide yacht owners with valuable support and resources. These networks often offer access to training, industry news, and best practices. They can also provide a platform for sharing experiences and learning from other yacht owners. Mentioning your involvement in professional networks or associations on your resume can further bolster your credibility with insurance carriers.\nSecuring Your Investment and Peace of Mind\nA jump in size and/or number of engines in some instances can impact your insurability. Insurance carriers rely on a detailed resume of experience to assess whether the yacht is being operated by an insured or by a captain accustomed to navigating similar vessels. Additionally, the cost of ownership and maintenance of the yacht has become more complex and more expensive.\nWhether you are purchasing a new yacht with significant differences in size and engine capacity from your prior yachting experience, providing a comprehensive resume of your experience upfront is essential.\nEnsuring that your resume includes detailed information about your yachting history, education, certifications, and relevant occupational skills can significantly enhance your chances of obtaining the best possible boat insurance or\nyacht insurance coverage\n. This proactive approach not only protects your investment against partial losses or replacement costs but also contributes to a safer, more enjoyable yachting experience.\nThe resume of experience is not just a formality but a crucial document that reflects your capability and commitment as a yacht owner. It serves as a testament to your skills, knowledge, and dedication to safe yachting practices. By providing a detailed, comprehensive resume of your experience upfront, you can build confidence with insurance carriers, ensuring you receive the liability insurance and physical damage coverage you need to protect your valuable asset and enjoy the full benefits of yacht ownership.\nFAQs About Yacht Insurance\nWhat Factors Affect the Cost of Yacht Insurance?\nSeveral factors influence your premium, including the vessel\u2019s value, size, age, cruising area (navigation limits), your boating resume, and the deductible you choose.\nWhat is a Normal Deductible?\nA deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before insurance covers the rest. For yachts, this is typically a percentage of the insured value (often 1% to 2%). An increased Named Storm Deductible is also applicable to most yacht policies. Note that in the event of a total loss, the deductible application may vary based on your specific policy terms.\nDo I Need Yacht Insurance for International Waters?\nStandard boat insurance usually has specific territorial limits. If you plan to travel internationally, you must inform your broker to ensure your yacht insurance coverage extends to those regions.\nWhat Are the Exclusions from Yacht Insurance Policies?\nStandard exclusions include wear and tear, gradual deterioration, osmosis, and damage caused by lack of maintenance. Indemnity is generally intended for sudden, accidental losses, not for maintenance issues.\nReady to upgrade your vessel?

Offering \u201cagreed value\u201d policies ensures reimbursement based on the insured value of the boat.\nMedical Payments:\nThis covers medical expenses for injuries sustained by crew members or passengers.\nPollution Liability:\nThis is essential coverage for environmental cleanup and damages resulting from your boat leaking fuel or oil into the water.\nPersonal Property Coverage:\nThis protects personal belongings aboard.\nUninsured Boater Coverage:\nThis coverage provides bodily injury protection in the event of an accident involving an uninsured boater or underinsured boater.\nAdditional Optional Coverages:\nCoverage for fishing equipment and other special items\nCrew coverage under the\nJones Act\nCharter Insurance vs. Pleasure-Use Boat Insurance\nUnderstanding the distinctions between charter insurance and pleasure-use boat insurance is crucial for ensuring proper coverage tailored to your vessel\u2019s intended purpose.\nIntended Use: Pleasure vs. Commercial\nPleasure Use Policy:\nCovers private, non-commercial activities; excludes commercial activities.\nCharter Policy:\nDesigned for vessels used for hire; often required if operating under a USCG credential.\nLiability Coverage\nPleasure:\nLimited to personal use; doesn\u2019t cover injuries to paying passengers.\nCharter:\nCovers bodily injury and legal liability to charter passengers; may include Jones Act coverage for captain/crew.\nPassenger Risk\nPleasure:\nCovers guests, not passengers for hire.\nCharter:\nCovers paying clients; includes charter passenger liability and possibly crew coverage.\nCompliance and Endorsements\nCharter Policies:\nRequire proof of Coast Guard licensing, vessel inspections, commercial endorsements, and possible Jones Act coverage.\nPleasure Policies:\nVoid coverage if used for commercial purposes.\nCost\nCharter Insurance:\nMore expensive due to increased risk; premiums depend on various factors like vessel size, number of passengers, cruising area, and charter type.\nWhat Is a Bareboat Charter?\nA bareboat charter is when you lease the vessel without crew, fuel, or provisions, and the charterer takes full responsibility for its operation.\nWho\u2019s in Charge?\nBareboat Charter:\nThe charterer is responsible for hiring their own captain and crew, assuming legal and operational control.\nCrewed (For-Hire) Charter:\nThe vessel owner/operator supplies a licensed captain and crew.\nLegal & Regulatory Differences\nFeature\nBareboat Charter\nCrewed/For-Hire Charter\nControl of Vessel\nCharterer (renter)\nVessel Owner\nUSCG Inspection\nNot required (if under 12 passengers)\nVessel must be operated by a Master who holds an OUPV Merchant Mariner Credential and Coast Guard safety inspections may be required.\nCaptain Provided?\nNo (must be hired by charterer)\nYes (provided by vessel owner/operator)\nLiability\nOn the charterer\nOn the vessel owner/operator\nPassenger Limit*\nA chartered vessel may NOT carry more than 12 passengers without a Certificate of Inspection (COI)\n6 for UPVs (uninspected) vessels less than 100 GRT greater than 100 GRT can carry up to 12 passengers\nInsurance Type Needed\nBareboat-specific charter policy\nCommercial/charter boat insurance\n*\nReference link:\nhttps://wow.uscgaux.info/Uploads_wowII/P-DEPT/PaxForHire_trifold.pdf\nCommon Pitfall: Bareboat Charters\nThe USCG enforces strict regulations on charters that appear like bareboat charters but operate like crewed charters. Red flags include:\nThe owner picking the captain for the charterer.\nPre-stocked fuel, drinks, or supplies.\nThe crew was paid by the boat owner.\nPassengers think they\u2019re just renting a boat with a crew.\nInsurance Differences\nBareboat Charter Insurance:\nThis needs to cover hull, liability, and passenger injury; stricter underwriting is required due to the liability shift.\nCrewed Charter Insurance:\nThis type of insurance covers the vessel, passengers, captain, and crew under commercial marine insurance policies.\nWhat Affects the Cost of Charter Boat Insurance?\nThe\ncost of charter boat insurance\ndepends on various factors. Understanding these elements can help charter operators evaluate policies effectively.\nBoat Value and Type:\nHigher-value vessels or specialized watercraft (e.g., fishing boats) may carry higher premiums.\nOperating Area:\nGeographic location impacts risk assessments.

Some incidents happen often enough to give all boat owners reason to pause and wonder:\ndoes my boat have insurance\n?\nIf you\u2019re in the market to buy a boat, marine insurance is\none of the most important things to consider\nduring that process.\nWhile boat insurance isn\u2019t required in Florida, it\u2019s a sound strategy to purchase a policy. No one can predict what will happen out on the water, and even the most careful captain can encounter difficulties on the waterways. Marine insurance exists to bail out boat owners during what could otherwise be\na financial disaster or the loss of your boat\n.\nWhat\u2019s more, the coverage offers peace of mind. Every time you head out on the water, know that you\u2019re protected by the invisible but vital coverage of Florida boat insurance.\nWhy do I need boat insurance?\nAccidents happen.\nBoats collide. They sink. They hit docks, break their tethers during storms, experience a crushed t-top when the tree they\u2019re parked underneath drops a huge branch. The list is long, and a Florida marine insurance advisor will have plenty of stories to share that prove coverage is truly imperative.\nBoat collision insurance is a popular coverage option, because the reality of a craft crashing into yours (or the other way around) is a possible one. Stories about such instances are widespread. If you collide with another boat and your passengers or the other boat\u2019s passengers are injured, you could be sued. You could be taken to court for\nmedical expenses\nand more. The correct marine insurance coverage will mitigate the damage.\nHomeowners insurance isn\u2019t enough.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the water, you\u2019re going to need the\nspecialized coverage\nthat only a solid marine insurance policy provides. And before you worry about sticker shock, it\u2019s likely less expensive than you might think. Partner with a Florida marine insurance advisor who has access to A-rated markets and understands how to combine coverages into an entire package, and you can find comprehensive coverage without breaking the bank.\nWhat does boat insurance cover?\nAs with most insurance coverage options, you can make your boat policy an\na la carte\ncombo of what is important to you as a boat owner. You\u2019ll have different types of insurance to choose from. Partnering with a seasoned marine insurance advisor will take much of the work off your plate.\nDifferent types of boating insurance include:\nCollision\nWhen two crafts collide, the results can be disastrous. There can be a loss of life, a loss of property, or, at the very least, the need for repairs on the craft. Purchase boat collision insurance (hull and liability coverage) to safeguard yourself against these costs. And remember: It\u2019s not enough to say that you\u2019ll just be \u2018extra careful\u2019 out there on the water. A collision takes two captains to occur \u2013 and that other boat driver may not be as experienced or careful as you are. They also may not carry insurance, leaving the financial burden on you.\nComprehensive\nComprehensive insurance (included in hull coverage)on your boat includes vandalism and theft. When you leave that expensive navigation equipment or personal items on board you\u2019re leaving yourself open to possible theft. In fact, your entire boat could be taken or damaged through vandalism \u2013 intentional or natural. Comprehensive coverage provides the money needed to restore the boat to shipshape condition.\nLiability\nDon\u2019t skip this coverage; if you\u2019re found liable for loss of property or physical damage to another person, a claim against you for liability can be in the millions. This will even cover your defense costs if that becomes necessary.\nThe 10 Most Common Boat Insurance Claims\nWe\u2019ve compiled some common Florida boat insurance claims in order to show you how beneficial it continues to be for boat owners.\n1. Hurricanes\nFloridians live with the threat of these mega storms on a regular basis. Some common insurance claims having to do with hurricane damage include boats improperly secured on lifts and vessels that are damaged by storm debris.\u00a0 Most marine policies have an increased deductible for Named (or numbered) Storms.\n2. Windy Weather\nIt doesn\u2019t take the wrath of a hurricane to damage a boat by weather. Tornados can wreak havoc on a boat, and a windstorm strong enough to turn objects into projectiles can severely damage a boat.\n3. Sinking (as the result of a covered loss)\nRecovering a boat that has sunk underneath the water can be majorly expensive; that is, unless you carry boat insurance that covers this unfortunate event.\n4. Hitting Underwater Objects\nEven the best viewfinder doesn\u2019t always function perfectly. Hit an underwater object, and the damage to your hull may render your craft useless. What\u2019s more, that underwater object can result in the sinking of your boat.\n5. Fire and Explosion\nA fire or explosion can completely total your boat. Imagine not having insurance in this situation; you would have no recompense and would have to count your vessel as a complete loss.\n6. Collision With Another Boat\nThis is a very real possibility. It\u2019s so important to carry boat collision coverage (hull and liability coverage) for legal and financial purposes alike. An accident in which both boat owners carry insurance is going to be much less devastating on the pocketbook than one in which neither (or just one) has it. Remember: a court can order you to pay damages to another party, even if you cannot afford to do so. Cover yourself in case this does happen, and you safeguard not only your current bank account, but your future earnings as well.\n7. Grounding\nRunning a boat aground is unfortunately common; thanks to the ever-changing levels of tides, it\u2019s easy to misjudge or forget that certain parts of the waterways are not deep enough. Rescuing and repairing a boat that has run aground requires some specialized assistance \u2013 and that can be expensive if paying out-of-pocket.\n8. Equipment Theft\nEven the most careful captain (and your crew) can forget to remove equipment from a boat. If you regularly stow expensive items aboard, protect the collection by insuring it.\n9. Boat Theft\nShould your boat be stolen, Florida boat insurance can make the sting a little less severe. You\u2019ll be able to purchase a new vessel to continue your exploration of the Sunshine State waterways. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be left with a boat lift or trailer that stands empty until you can save enough money to purchase a new vessel.\n10. Lightning\nThis is covered by marine insurance when you purchase hull coverage.\u00a0 It\u2019s a huge risk factor for Florida boats and replacing your navigational equipment can be quite costly.\nContact W3 Insurance for a quote\nHopefully, this article inspires you to do the right thing for yourself and your passengers: purchase a marine insurance policy. It\u2019s not a luxury; it\u2019s protection.

The sun is just beginning to rise over the lake, the light glinting off your carefully organized gear. But as you navigate toward your favorite fishing spot, an unexpected underwater obstacle damages your hull\u2014or worse, another boater without insurance collides with your vessel.\nOwning a bass fishing boat is a dream come true for many anglers. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned tournament competitor, you own a bass fishing charter boat, or you enjoy leisurely fishing trips, protecting your investment is crucial.\nProper watercraft insurance\ncan safeguard your boat, equipment, charter operations, and financial well-being.\nBass fishing boats represent significant investments, often ranging from $30,000 to well over $100,000 when you factor in specialized equipment. A single accident, theft, or natural disaster can result in devastating financial losses. That\u2019s why smart anglers understand that insurance isn\u2019t just an expense\u2014it\u2019s essential protection for their passion and livelihood.\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll explore the key insurance considerations for bass fishing boat owners and offer tips to ensure you have the right coverage.\nRequest a Quote\nWhy Insurance Is Essential for Bass Fishing Boats\nBass fishing boats face unique risks, making insurance coverage particularly important. They\u2019re specialized vessels that venture into challenging waters, carry expensive equipment, and face exposure to both natural and human-caused hazards.\nEquipped with specialized gear and high-performance engines, bass fishing boats are significant investments. Accidents, theft, and natural disasters can lead to substantial financial losses. Watercraft insurance provides peace of mind by covering these risks and ensuring you\u2019re protected both on and off the water.\nThe risks are real and varied. Tournament anglers frequently travel to unfamiliar waters where hidden obstacles pose constant threats. Weather conditions can change rapidly, turning a peaceful fishing trip into a dangerous situation. Equipment theft is a common occurrence, particularly when boats are stored at marinas or boat ramps. Even responsible anglers can face liability issues if their boat causes property damage or bodily injury to others.\nConsider these scenarios: A sudden storm damages your boat\u2019s electronics and hull while you\u2019re seeking shelter. Your trailer tire blows out on the highway, leaving you stranded with thousands of dollars of equipment. Or, say, another boater without insurance crashes into your vessel, injuring your passengers and causing extensive damage. Without\nproper insurance coverage\n, any of these situations could result in financial hardship.\nTypes of Coverage for Bass Fishing Boats\nUnderstanding the different types of insurance coverage options available helps you build a comprehensive protection plan tailored to your specific needs as a bass angler.\n1. Hull Insurance\nHull insurance is the foundation of any boat insurance policy. It protects against sudden and accidental physical damage to your boat, including collisions with other boats, underwater objects, or fixed structures like docks. This coverage also extends to damage from storms, vandalism, and theft of the boat itself.\nFor bass fishing boats, hull insurance becomes even more critical due to their specialized construction and high-performance components. A damaged hull can render your boat unsafe and unusable, potentially incurring tens of thousands of dollars in repair or replacement costs.\n2. Equipment and Gear Coverage\nModern bass boats are floating electronics platforms. Fish finders, GPS units, trolling motors, and rod-and-reel combinations can easily total $15,000 or more. Standard boat insurance policies may not fully cover these specialized items, making electronic equipment and personal effects/fishing equipment coverage essential. Some policies may even have a lower deductible available for these coverages.\nElectronic equipment and personal effects coverage protects these expensive items from damage, loss, or theft (which is, unfortunately, quite common at boat ramps and marinas). It also covers damage to equipment from accidents or storms. Some policies offer replacement cost coverage while others provide actual cash value based on depreciation. This makes a difference should a covered loss occur.\n3. Liability Insurance\nBass fishing often takes place in crowded tournament conditions or in popular fishing areas where boat traffic is heavy. Liability insurance protects you if you\u2019re found legally responsible for bodily injury or property damage to others. This coverage pays for medical expenses to a 3rd party, legal defense costs, and property damage awards.\nThe financial exposure from\nliability claims\ncan be enormous. A serious accident resulting in permanent injury could lead to judgments in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. Without adequate liability coverage, your personal assets could be at risk.\n4. Uninsured Boater Coverage\nNot all boaters carry adequate liability insurance. Uninsured boater coverage protects you if you\u2019re involved in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured boater who caused bodily injury.\nThis coverage is critical because boat insurance isn\u2019t required in most states, including Florida. Many recreational boaters operate without any insurance coverage at all, leaving responsible boat owners vulnerable to financial losses from accidents caused by uninsured operators.\n5. Pollution Coverage\nEnvironmental protection agencies take fuel spills seriously, and cleanup costs can quickly reach thousands of dollars. Pollution liability coverage helps pay for containment and cleanup expenses, though it usually excludes fines and penalties imposed by regulatory agencies.\nFor bass anglers who care about preserving the waterways they love, pollution coverage demonstrates environmental responsibility while protecting against unexpected costs.\nTips for Choosing the Right Watercraft Insurance\nSelecting the right insurance policy requires careful consideration of your specific needs, fishing habits, and financial situation.\nAssess Your Needs:\nConsider the value of your boat and equipment, your fishing habits, and the areas you typically fish in. Do you primarily fish in small lakes or venture into larger bodies of water? Different environments present different risks. Tailor your marine insurance coverage to match your specific needs.\nContact Us:\nConsult with a WWW Marine Insurance Advisor\nfor personalized guidance and comprehensive coverage tailored to your specific needs. Protect your investment and enjoy your fishing adventures with confidence, backed by a reliable insurance company.\nUnderstand Policy Limits:\nReview the policy limits, terms and conditions,, and exclusions carefully. Ensure your coverage is sufficient to protect against the potential risks you may face on the water.\nWhen evaluating insurance options, consider your purchase price for your bass boat plus added electronics. Tournament anglers may require higher coverage limits due to the expense of their equipment and frequent travel. Weekend recreational anglers, on the other hand, may prioritize different aspects of coverage.\nYour deductible choice has a significant impact on your premiums. Higher deductibles reduce premium costs but increase out-of-pocket expenses when claims are filed. Choose a deductible amount you can comfortably afford in case of a loss.\nReviewing Policy Limits and Ensuring Sufficient Coverage\nUnderstanding policy limits and exclusions is crucial for ensuring adequate protection. Many boat owners discover too late that their coverage falls short of their actual needs.\nReview your policy\u2019s navigation limits carefully. Some policies restrict coverage to specific geographic areas or limit the distance you can travel offshore. If you fish in multiple states or plan to travel to distant tournaments, ensure your policy covers these activities.\nPay attention to exclusions in your policy. Standard exclusions include wear and tear, gradual deterioration, and damage from lack of maintenance. Some policies may exclude coverage for commercial activities, which could affect tournament anglers who accept prize money.\nSafeguarding Your Investment and Your Passion\nSavvy bass anglers understand that insurance isn\u2019t just about protecting your financial investment\u2014it\u2019s about preserving your ability to pursue your passion. A comprehensive insurance policy allows you to focus on what matters most: finding that perfect fishing spot and landing the bass of a lifetime.\nWhether you\u2019re heading out for a weekend fishing trip or preparing for a major tournament, knowing you\u2019re protected against unexpected events allows you to concentrate on your fishing strategy instead of worrying about potential disasters.\nBy understanding the types of coverage available and following our tips for choosing the right policy, you can safeguard your boat and equipment against unexpected events. Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. Review your insurance needs today and make sure you\u2019re fully covered.\nRequest a Quote\nFAQs\nHow Much Is Insurance for a Fishing Boat?\nYour location, experience level, claims history, and chosen coverage limits also affect pricing. Florida boat owners typically pay higher premiums due to hurricane risks and the high volume of boat traffic. Our northern boatowners may have a lesser premium due to the winter lay-up season.\nShould I Insure My Fishing Boat?\nYes, you should insure your fishing boat. While not legally required in most states, insurance provides crucial financial protection for your investment. Without insurance, you\u2019re personally liable for damages, injuries, and losses. The cost of repairing or replacing a damaged boat, combined with potential liability claims, can easily exceed the annual insurance premium by thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.\nHow Do You Estimate Boat Insurance?\nTo estimate boat insurance costs, gather information about your boat\u2019s make, model, year, length, and value. Consider your desired coverage limits for liability, hull damage, and equipment. Your boating experience, location, and intended use affect rates. Speaking with one of our\u00a0 marine insurance specialists is a great strategy for obtaining quotes. They will assess your specific needs and recommend appropriate coverage levels for your bass fishing activities.\nWhat Does Boat Insurance Not Cover?\nBoat insurance typically excludes wear and tear, gradual deterioration, and damage from lack of maintenance. Racing activities, commercial use, and intentional damage are usually excluded. Many policies don\u2019t cover personal property not permanently attached to the boat. Navigation outside specified limits stated in your boat insurance policy may void coverage. Pollution fines and penalties are often excluded, though cleanup costs may be covered. Always review your policy\u2019s specific exclusions with your insurance agent to ensure you understand them.\nWhy Is Boat Insurance So Hard to Get?\nObtaining boat insurance can be challenging due to several factors. High-risk categories, such as high-performance boats or older vessels, often face stricter underwriting criteria, as they\u2019re more prone to accidents, mechanical issues, or extensive damage. Additionally, insurers may require detailed surveys or inspections to assess the boat\u2019s condition, which can result in delays or additional costs. Geographic considerations also play a role, as boats operated in hurricane-prone areas or regions with high theft rates may result in stricter conditions or higher premiums. Finally, lack of experience or a poor claims history on the part of the boat owner can further complicate the process, as insurers perceive these factors as increased risks.\nOur team of specialists write boat insurance all day everyday so let them take the \u2018hard\u2019 out of finding you a policy that meets\u00a0 your needs.

Red flags include:\nThe owner picking the captain for the charterer.\nPre-stocked fuel, drinks, or supplies.\nThe crew was paid by the boat owner.\nPassengers think they\u2019re just renting a boat with a crew.\nInsurance Differences\nBareboat Charter Insurance:\nThis needs to cover hull, liability, and passenger injury; stricter underwriting is required due to the liability shift.\nCrewed Charter Insurance:\nThis type of insurance covers the vessel, passengers, captain, and crew under commercial marine insurance policies.\nWhat Affects the Cost of Charter Boat Insurance?\nThe\ncost of charter boat insurance\ndepends on various factors. Understanding these elements can help charter operators evaluate policies effectively.\nBoat Value and Type:\nHigher-value vessels or specialized watercraft (e.g., fishing boats) may carry higher premiums.\nOperating Area:\nGeographic location impacts risk assessments.

Some incidents happen often enough to give all boat owners reason to pause and wonder:\ndoes my boat have insurance\n?\nIf you\u2019re in the market to buy a boat, marine insurance is\none of the most important things to consider\nduring that process.\nWhile boat insurance isn\u2019t required in Florida, it\u2019s a sound strategy to purchase a policy. No one can predict what will happen out on the water, and even the most careful captain can encounter difficulties on the waterways. Marine insurance exists to bail out boat owners during what could otherwise be\na financial disaster or the loss of your boat\n.\nWhat\u2019s more, the coverage offers peace of mind. Every time you head out on the water, know that you\u2019re protected by the invisible but vital coverage of Florida boat insurance.\nWhy do I need boat insurance?\nAccidents happen.\nBoats collide. They sink. They hit docks, break their tethers during storms, experience a crushed t-top when the tree they\u2019re parked underneath drops a huge branch. The list is long, and a Florida marine insurance advisor will have plenty of stories to share that prove coverage is truly imperative.\nBoat collision insurance is a popular coverage option, because the reality of a craft crashing into yours (or the other way around) is a possible one. Stories about such instances are widespread. If you collide with another boat and your passengers or the other boat\u2019s passengers are injured, you could be sued. You could be taken to court for\nmedical expenses\nand more. The correct marine insurance coverage will mitigate the damage.\nHomeowners insurance isn\u2019t enough.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the water, you\u2019re going to need the\nspecialized coverage\nthat only a solid marine insurance policy provides. And before you worry about sticker shock, it\u2019s likely less expensive than you might think. Partner with a Florida marine insurance advisor who has access to A-rated markets and understands how to combine coverages into an entire package, and you can find comprehensive coverage without breaking the bank.\nWhat does boat insurance cover?\nAs with most insurance coverage options, you can make your boat policy an\na la carte\ncombo of what is important to you as a boat owner. You\u2019ll have different types of insurance to choose from. Partnering with a seasoned marine insurance advisor will take much of the work off your plate.\nDifferent types of boating insurance include:\nCollision\nWhen two crafts collide, the results can be disastrous. There can be a loss of life, a loss of property, or, at the very least, the need for repairs on the craft. Purchase boat collision insurance (hull and liability coverage) to safeguard yourself against these costs. And remember: It\u2019s not enough to say that you\u2019ll just be \u2018extra careful\u2019 out there on the water. A collision takes two captains to occur \u2013 and that other boat driver may not be as experienced or careful as you are. They also may not carry insurance, leaving the financial burden on you.\nComprehensive\nComprehensive insurance (included in hull coverage)on your boat includes vandalism and theft. When you leave that expensive navigation equipment or personal items on board you\u2019re leaving yourself open to possible theft. In fact, your entire boat could be taken or damaged through vandalism \u2013 intentional or natural. Comprehensive coverage provides the money needed to restore the boat to shipshape condition.\nLiability\nDon\u2019t skip this coverage; if you\u2019re found liable for loss of property or physical damage to another person, a claim against you for liability can be in the millions. This will even cover your defense costs if that becomes necessary.\nThe 10 Most Common Boat Insurance Claims\nWe\u2019ve compiled some common Florida boat insurance claims in order to show you how beneficial it continues to be for boat owners.\n1. Hurricanes\nFloridians live with the threat of these mega storms on a regular basis. Some common insurance claims having to do with hurricane damage include boats improperly secured on lifts and vessels that are damaged by storm debris.\u00a0 Most marine policies have an increased deductible for Named (or numbered) Storms.\n2. Windy Weather\nIt doesn\u2019t take the wrath of a hurricane to damage a boat by weather. Tornados can wreak havoc on a boat, and a windstorm strong enough to turn objects into projectiles can severely damage a boat.\n3. Sinking (as the result of a covered loss)\nRecovering a boat that has sunk underneath the water can be majorly expensive; that is, unless you carry boat insurance that covers this unfortunate event.\n4. Hitting Underwater Objects\nEven the best viewfinder doesn\u2019t always function perfectly. Hit an underwater object, and the damage to your hull may render your craft useless. What\u2019s more, that underwater object can result in the sinking of your boat.\n5. Fire and Explosion\nA fire or explosion can completely total your boat. Imagine not having insurance in this situation; you would have no recompense and would have to count your vessel as a complete loss.\n6. Collision With Another Boat\nThis is a very real possibility. It\u2019s so important to carry boat collision coverage (hull and liability coverage) for legal and financial purposes alike. An accident in which both boat owners carry insurance is going to be much less devastating on the pocketbook than one in which neither (or just one) has it. Remember: a court can order you to pay damages to another party, even if you cannot afford to do so. Cover yourself in case this does happen, and you safeguard not only your current bank account, but your future earnings as well.\n7. Grounding\nRunning a boat aground is unfortunately common; thanks to the ever-changing levels of tides, it\u2019s easy to misjudge or forget that certain parts of the waterways are not deep enough. Rescuing and repairing a boat that has run aground requires some specialized assistance \u2013 and that can be expensive if paying out-of-pocket.\n8. Equipment Theft\nEven the most careful captain (and your crew) can forget to remove equipment from a boat. If you regularly stow expensive items aboard, protect the collection by insuring it.\n9. Boat Theft\nShould your boat be stolen, Florida boat insurance can make the sting a little less severe. You\u2019ll be able to purchase a new vessel to continue your exploration of the Sunshine State waterways. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be left with a boat lift or trailer that stands empty until you can save enough money to purchase a new vessel.\n10. Lightning\nThis is covered by marine insurance when you purchase hull coverage.\u00a0 It\u2019s a huge risk factor for Florida boats and replacing your navigational equipment can be quite costly.\nContact W3 Insurance for a quote\nHopefully, this article inspires you to do the right thing for yourself and your passengers: purchase a marine insurance policy.

Why a Resume of Experience Matters for Yacht Insurance\nDecember 23, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    In\nYacht Insurance\nWhen you are looking to insure pleasure use yachts, the process can sometimes feel complicated. However, one of the most critical factors insurance companies look at isn\u2019t just the boat itself\u2014it\u2019s you. Specifically, underwriters want to understand your history and overall experience as an owner.\nIn the world of yachting, experience is everything. This is especially true when you decide to purchase a vessel that is significantly different from ones you have owned before. For example, if your yacht owner\u2019s history consists of vessels under 60 feet and you are now buying a 75-foot vessel, this \u201cjump in length\u201d is significant. It might require hiring a full-time captain to navigate the yacht.\nPerhaps you are moving from twin-engine fishing boats to a sportfish with quads. This increase in power may cause concern for underwriters, potentially leading to a higher deductible or a \u201cNamed Operator Warranty\u201d on the\nyacht insurance policy\n.\nIn these scenarios, carriers often require a detailed resume of your experience, including any loss/claim history, before providing an insurance quote. But why is this such a significant factor? Let\u2019s dive in.\nRequest a Quote for Yacht Insurance\nUnderstanding the \u201cJump\u201d in Length and Power\nFor any yacht, the size and the power of its engines can significantly affect both its performance and the boating safety of its operation. The length overall of the yacht and the number of engines it has influence several important aspects.\n1. Safety and Stability\nA larger yacht usually requires advanced handling techniques because it is less maneuverable than a smaller boat. Similarly, multiple engines provide more power but introduce different handling characteristics, especially in rough waters.\n2. Performance Expectations\nLarger yachts with more powerful engines travel faster and cover greater distances. However, this comes with increased risk. A jump in length or power changes how the vessel behaves, and without proper experience, a yachter may struggle to control it within their navigation limits.\n3. Wear and Tear\nLarger yachts undergo greater stresses, which affect durability. Marine insurance providers need to understand this to evaluate risks accurately and adjust premiums or coverage options.\n4. Operational Complexity\nManaging a yacht\nwith increased length or multiple engines is far more complex than handling a smaller, single-engine yacht. The operation of additional engines requires a greater understanding of engine synchronization and fuel management, especially in an emergency.\nWhy Insurance Carriers Need a Resume of Experience Upfront\nProviding a boating resume isn\u2019t just paperwork; it\u2019s about securing the right insurance protection for your specific needs.\nComprehensive Risk Assessment\nA yacht\u2019s size and power are directly tied to the risks an insurer needs to account for. The larger and more powerful the yacht, the higher the potential for property damage or bodily injury in an accident. By providing a resume upfront, insurance carriers can assess the operator\u2019s experience with the yacht\u2019s specifications to determine if they can handle the associated risks. This proactive risk management approach enables a thorough evaluation from the outset.\nEnhanced Accuracy and Efficiency\nSubmitting a resume upfront ensures that all relevant details about the yacht owner\u2019s experience are available early in the process. This minimizes the risk of discrepancies and provides consistent information. It also streamlines the decision-making process regarding insurance solutions, leading to faster processing times and quicker application approval.\nHandling and Maintenance Knowledge\nHandling a larger yacht with multiple engines requires specific skills. Whether it\u2019s docking, navigating tight spots, or dealing with rough waters, these skills need to be built up over time. Insurance companies want to ensure that the yacht operator has experience with these nuances. A resume of experience that demonstrates a history of safe operation helps reassure insurers that the yacht is in capable hands.\nMoreover,\nregular maintenance of larger yachts\nis crucial. Insurance carriers want to know that the yacht owner is proactive about maintaining the yacht properly, as this significantly affects the risk of mechanical failure or accidents.\nCustomized Coverage\nWith larger yachts or those with more complex systems, a generic policy\u2014or relying on standard homeowners endorsements\u2014will not provide the necessary coverage. A resume of experience helps insurers craft a policy that offers the right\nyacht insurance coverage\n.\nWhen we look at your experience, we can better structure the policy to address:\nHull Coverage:\nProtection for physical damage to your vessel\nAgreed Value vs. Actual Cash Value:\nDetermining whether your policy covers the agreed value (the insured amount decided at the start) or the actual cash value (which factors in depreciation)\nLiability Coverage:\nEssential protection and indemnity (P&I) for third-party liabilities, including bodily injury and property damage\nMedical Payments:\nCoverage for necessary medical expenses for you or your passengers\nUninsured Boater:\nProtection if you are hit by someone who lacks proper coverage\nPersonal Property and Personal Effects:\nProtecting your belongings on board, separate from the vessel itself\nWreck Removal:\nCovering the cost to remove your vessel if it sinks or blocks a waterway\nJones Act:\nCoverage for crew members\nif you employ a captain or crew\nLay-up:\nDefining periods when the boat is out of commission, which can affect premiums\nUnderstanding these coverage options helps you answer the question, \u201cWhat kind of insurance do you need for a yacht?\u201d versus a smaller boat.\nRequest a Quote for Yacht Insurance\nYachtsman Education and Experience\nYachtsman education, certifications such as Merchant Marine, Captains License, USCG Auxiliary, or United States Power Squadron courses, and hands-on experience play a vital role in how an insurer assesses risk. Underwriters prefer operators with a proven track record. By detailing your certifications and boating courses, you can improve your chances of receiving comprehensive insurance solutions at the most competitive terms and premiums.\nDemonstrating a commitment to boating safety and continuous learning\u2014such as staying up to date on navigation limits and new technologies\u2014builds trust. This transparency can positively influence the terms of your policy, offering you greater peace of mind.\nBuilding Trust and Credibility\nProviding a resume upfront demonstrates transparency and a willingness to share comprehensive information. This builds trust with the underwriters and shows that the yacht owner is serious about the application process. It reassures insurance carriers that the owner is committed to safe and knowledgeable yachting practices, which can positively influence the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.\nAdditional Considerations for Yacht Owners\nThe Role of Technology in Modern Yachting\nModern yachts are equipped with advanced technology that can enhance safety and performance, but also add to the complexity of operation. A detailed resume of experience should highlight any training or experience the yacht owner has with these technologies. This can further reassure insurance carriers that the owner is well-prepared to handle the sophisticated systems onboard.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nLarger yachts and those with multiple engines can have a greater environmental impact. Responsible yacht ownership includes understanding and mitigating this impact. Demonstrating a commitment to environmental stewardship can be a positive factor when seeking insurance coverage.\nThe Importance of Continuous Learning\nThe world of yachting is constantly evolving. Continuous learning is essential for staying up to date and ensuring safe, responsible yacht operation. Including a history of continuous learning on your resume of experience can demonstrate to insurers that you are committed to maintaining and enhancing your skills over time.\nThe Role of Professional Networks\nBeing part of professional yachting networks or associations can provide yacht owners with valuable support and resources. These networks often offer access to training, industry news, and best practices. They can also provide a platform for sharing experiences and learning from other yacht owners. Mentioning your involvement in professional networks or associations on your resume can further bolster your credibility with insurance carriers.\nSecuring Your Investment and Peace of Mind\nA jump in size and/or number of engines in some instances can impact your insurability. Insurance carriers rely on a detailed resume of experience to assess whether the yacht is being operated by an insured or by a captain accustomed to navigating similar vessels. Additionally, the cost of ownership and maintenance of the yacht has become more complex and more expensive.\nWhether you are purchasing a new yacht with significant differences in size and engine capacity from your prior yachting experience, providing a comprehensive resume of your experience upfront is essential.\nEnsuring that your resume includes detailed information about your yachting history, education, certifications, and relevant occupational skills can significantly enhance your chances of obtaining the best possible boat insurance or\nyacht insurance coverage\n. This proactive approach not only protects your investment against partial losses or replacement costs but also contributes to a safer, more enjoyable yachting experience.\nThe resume of experience is not just a formality but a crucial document that reflects your capability and commitment as a yacht owner. It serves as a testament to your skills, knowledge, and dedication to safe yachting practices. By providing a detailed, comprehensive resume of your experience upfront, you can build confidence with insurance carriers, ensuring you receive the liability insurance and physical damage coverage you need to protect your valuable asset and enjoy the full benefits of yacht ownership.\nFAQs About Yacht Insurance\nWhat Factors Affect the Cost of Yacht Insurance?\nSeveral factors influence your premium, including the vessel\u2019s value, size, age, cruising area (navigation limits), your boating resume, and the deductible you choose.\nWhat is a Normal Deductible?\nA deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before insurance covers the rest. For yachts, this is typically a percentage of the insured value (often 1% to 2%). An increased Named Storm Deductible is also applicable to most yacht policies. Note that in the event of a total loss, the deductible application may vary based on your specific policy terms.\nDo I Need Yacht Insurance for International Waters?\nStandard boat insurance usually has specific territorial limits. If you plan to travel internationally, you must inform your broker to ensure your yacht insurance coverage extends to those regions.\nWhat Are the Exclusions from Yacht Insurance Policies?\nStandard exclusions include wear and tear, gradual deterioration, osmosis, and damage caused by lack of maintenance. Indemnity is generally intended for sudden, accidental losses, not for maintenance issues.\nReady to upgrade your vessel?

Keep your vessel shipshape by shielding it from the elements and you\u2019ll reap the longevity benefits that come with a well-maintained marine craft.\nUnless you store your vessel indoors in a hurricane-safe storage facility, it\u2019s often difficult to keep it completely safe from the elements.\nThere are different ways to achieve this aim, and it\u2019s helpful to consider each one before making your ultimate boat storage selection. Reduce wear and tear on your boat by selecting the option that\u2019s right for you.\nFirst, let\u2019s answer the obvious question: Why is it important to properly store your boat? In a perfect world, boats would be impervious to the effects of weather or corrosion. You could park your vessel in the driveway and never worry about a tree falling and damaging onboard contents; it would be just fine to tie up to a dock and keep that hull bobbing in the water indefinitely. This is a world where corrosion exists, unfortunately. The threat of potentially violent weather poses a threat as well. Therefore, it is important to have a plan for securing your boat accordingly. How you do that is up to you, but this guide can help you decide.\nSo what are your boat storage Florida options? You can store the boat either in-the-water or out, covered or wide open. But there are more options than you might think. What really wins the blue ribbon for \u2018the best boat storage option\u2019 depends on the type of boat and the storage options that are actually nearby.\nThe answer that is right for one Florida boat owner is different from the answer for another. Here are some highlights of different boat storage modes and different boat storage ideas to consider.\nTypes of boat storage\nIn-water storage\nCaution: extra care necessary.\nLet\u2019s start with the easiest storage option available to everyone: in-the-water storage. If you do not care how long your vessel stays pristine, this is a great option. We suggest that you don\u2019t store your boat this way for any length of time. Your boat will be\nfully exposed\nto water, which can wear away at that shiny gel coat. Should a storm occur, the vessel could also break free of its mooring and float into another person\u2019s backyard waterway. If you absolutely have to leave your boat bobbing in the water, take care to\nsecure it extremely well\nwith lines. Hopefully, you have a plan to take it out and secure a different means of storage as soon as possible.\nAt-home storage\nUnless you plan to\nuse your garage for boat storage only\n, this will not work well. Trailering the boat and keeping it on the side of the house may be an option; if you choose to do that, make sure to take all items off the boat every time you park it and have a secure cover.\nLift storage\nFor those boat owners who use boat lifts, this is a viable means of boat storage. One of the benefits of lift storage is that the boat will be\neasy to launch\n; this may mean that you and your family will use it more often than you might if the vessel were at an offsite location. It takes mere seconds to lower a boat from its lofty lift perch and into the water. Within a minute or two, you and your family are then off on the next watery excursion.\nKeep in mind that when storing your boat on a lift, you must take care to\nproperly secure it in the event of inclement weather\n. A boat that is overrun by storm surge may break free of its tether. The Internet is full of shocking pictures of boats tipped half-in, half-out of the water or nudged into neighboring backyards by strong currents, wind, & tidal surge.\nPlatform lifts and profile lifts\nare two options, and as for cost, a good rule is to expect to pay approximately $1 for every pound that the lift will have to hoist. For the sake of preparedness, this is definitely a time to overestimate your costs.\nOutdoor boatyard\nAn outdoor boatyard is another option. It\u2019s essentially a car lot filled with boats. Covers can be used to offer further protection. Some boatyards are adjacent to marinas, but it will likely cost less to keep your vessel in the nearby boatyard than in the marina itself.\nMarina slips\nMarinas offer a few options for storing your boat. One option is the\nwet slip\n, in which a vessel will securely float in the water. Often, this storage area is covered and offers fair protection from the elements. Still, this is a version of that in-water storage that can lead to corrosion of the paint and other wear-and-tear.\nAnother option is a\nlift slip\n, which is just what it sounds like. The boat is lifted out of the water, which helps prevent the erosion it can suffer in the water.\nHowever, not every marina covers its lifts, meaning that the elements can affect the vessel. This can cause major problems if a storm hits and the boat is not properly secured.\nHigh-and-dry storage\nThis indoor option keeps your vessel out of the sun and surf. This is ideal for those who\ndo not plan to use the boat on a regular basis\n. It is necessary to call ahead and have someone remove your vessel from its perch before you can trailer it to the next destination. This adds another step to the preparation you must do before taking the boat out on the water, so consider whether high-and-dry storage is too much of a hassle.\nStorage costs\nThe cost to store a boat\nwill vary widely\nbased on the type of storage and the location of the facility. The cheapest mode of storage is obviously at-home storage. The most expensive will likely be at a marina, where you often reap the benefits of on-site security along with a convenient way to launch.\nNo matter which way you choose to store a boat, it is\nimportant to properly insure it\n. Though Florida does not require marine insurance for boat owners, electing not to purchase a policy is a huge risk. Many destruction scenarios can happen that involve a vessel, and accidents and property loss are only two. The best course of action is to\nselect a marine insurance advisor\nyou trust to build a personalized policy plan for you.\nExplore the water with confidence\nW3 Insurance protects vessels so that their owners can feel confident exploring the waterways. Boating is such a joy; protect yourself for the unexpected by trusting W3 Insurance with your boat insurance requirements.\nSpeak with an experienced W3 marine insurance advisor and\nrequest a quote today\n.\nYou might also like\nUpgrading Your Vessel?

Good news, it\u2019s not hard.\nHull Materials, Which Is Best?\nOne of the common debates in any sailor\u2019s bar is which hull material is best. John settles the argument\u2026it depends. But he does make some solid recommendations for hull materials most of us should avoid and the one that the majority should choose.\n15 Steps To Getting Securely Anchored\nWhen thinking about anchoring, it\u2019s easy to just focus on gear, but good technique can contribute at least as much to getting securely anchored. These steps, based on 40 years of experience, make getting securely anchored easy and repeatable.\n10 Tips to Make Coming Alongside (Docking) Easy\nThese tips, which we have developed over two decades of coming alongside double-handed in a 56-foot boat without a bow thruster, will take the stress out of docking and make it easy\u2026even fun too.\nReefing Made Easy\nHow to reef a sailboat easily and quickly without getting frightened or wet.\n4 Vital Anchor Selection Criteria and a Review of SPADE\nEveryone loves to tout the benefits of their favourite anchor, John included, but this article is about much more: how to cut through all the claims to the criteria that really matter when selecting an anchor.\n12 Tips To Avoid Ruining Our Easily Driven Sailboat\nWe bought a lovely easily driven offshore cruising sailboat, but it\u2019s all too easy to screw her up if we don\u2019t heed these tips.\n11 Things We Do To Stay Rational About Safety\nWe write a lot about safety here at AAC: crew overboard, storm survival, fire at sea, etc. All important stuff, but we worry about how this affects our primary goal here at Attainable Adventure Cruising of helping you go cruising. So here\u2019s how we balance safety with actually getting out there.\nBanishing Sidedeck Jacklines Forever\nWe have shown that sidedeck jacklines are deeply flawed and may even be more dangerous than no jacklines at all, due to drag risk and the false sense of security they confer. But can we get rid of them and still work our boats efficiently? Yes, we can! Here\u2019s how, with video proof.\nStopping Wave Strikes While Heaved-To\nSome of the options that we can use to solve the dangerous problem of wave strikes while heaved-to that I described in the last chapter.\nGet To Know Us Sign Up\nUpdates\nEmail\nFirst Name\nGet To Know Us\nPrivacy\nYou can unsubscribe at any time.\nShort version privacy policy:\nwe won\u2019t share your email with anyone.\nLong, but not so boring privacy policy\nContact\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nComment Tips\nRecent Comments\nConsulting\nBluesky\nFind Us On Facebook\nRSS Feed\n\u00a9 Attainable Adventure Cruising Ltd and the authors, all rights are reserved.\nNothing on this website or in direct communications received from us, or in our articles in the media, should be construed to mean or imply that offshore voyaging is anything other than potentially hazardous.

Previously, he was a homepage editor and digital content producer for Fox Sports, and before that a front page editor for Yahoo. He has decades of experience in digital and print media, including stints as a copy desk chief, a wire editor and a metro editor for the McClatchy newspaper chain.\nManaging Editor\n+\nmore\n\u00bb This article is out of date\nThe promotion described in this story has expired.\nSoccer fans who apply for the\nBank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card\nor\nBank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card\nwill have a chance to access tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026\u2122. For a limited time, new cardholders will potentially be able to purchase up to two tickets next year to select matches next year.\nThe offer is available only if you submit an application between Dec. 4, 2025, and Jan. 5, 2026, and the account must be open and established by Feb. 5, 2026, to qualify. A Visa card will be required to make the purchase.\nHere\u2019s how you can use this offer to potentially buy tickets.\n\u00bb MORE:\nNerdWallet's best credit cards for sports fans and athletes\nHow it works\nThere are a few key steps to complete for the chance to get tickets, and even then there\u2019s no guarantee. Thousands of tickets are offered while supplies last or until Feb. 24, 2026, on a first come, first served basis.\nStrategize your play\nBe prepared to map out your strategy. Eligible cardholders will receive an email on Feb. 10, 2026, at approximately 12 p.m. E.T. from Bank of America\u00ae with a link to the FIFA ticket website. Only one link is allowed per individual.\nMake sure your email address is up to date because every second counts. If Bank of America\u00ae doesn't have your email address, you can log into your account online or via the app to get the same link. It\u2019s also recommended to\nset up a FIFA ID\nin advance to save time upon checking out, according to Bank of America\u00ae\u2019s news release. You'll need that ID to purchase tickets.\nPlay forward\nTicket prices will vary by match, but the Bank of America\u00ae cards may offer a way to offset some of the cost.\nHere\u2019s how you can make the most of them:\nBank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card\n:\nThis card earns 3% cash back in a bonus category of your choice from a list (plus an additional 3% bonus in the first year), as well as 2% back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, on the first $2,500 in combined spending across all those categories per quarter. All other purchases earn 1% back. There's also a welcome bonus that can put some money back in your pocket: Receive a\n$200 online cash rewards bonus after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\nPlus, the card offers a promotional interest-free window that could help you pay down the cost of tickets over time. You'll get a\n0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases, and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. After the Intro APR offer ends, a Variable APR that\u2019s currently 17.49%-27.49%  will apply\n.\nBank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card\n:\nIn the first year of opening the account, you\u2019ll earn an unlimited 2% cash back that you could apply toward those ticket purchases. After that, you\u2019ll get 1.5% cash back. This card also comes with a welcome bonus: Get a\n$200 online cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of your account opening.\nAnd its promotional APR offer can also offer some breathing room: Receive a\n0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases, and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. After the Intro APR offer ends, a Variable APR that\u2019s currently 17.49%-27.49% will apply\n.\nFIFA World Cup 2026\u2122 ticket prices vary but they aren't cheap, so it\u2019s important to only charge them to your credit card if you know you\u2019ll be able to pay off the balance within the 0% introductory APR window.\n\u00bb MORE:\nBank of America\u00ae Preferred Rewards: What to know\nBe a good sport\nTickets to the FIFA World Cup 2026\u2122 can be hard to come by. Outside of this promotion, you can purchase tickets through sales phases available exclusively on FIFA\u2019s website. As of now, FIFA has offered a Visa presale draw exclusively for Visa cardholders and an early ticket draw that required an application process followed by a randomized selection. The next phase is the random selection draw, which required applications for specific matches.\nTicket sales for this offer are non-refundable and cannot be transferred, unless you do so through FIFA\u2019s official resale platform and pay the resale administration fee. An unauthorized resale may cancel the tickets without a refund.\nAbout the author\nMelissa Lambarena\nMelissa is a credit cards writer at NerdWallet.

Previously, he was a homepage editor and digital content producer for Fox Sports, and before that a front page editor for Yahoo. He has decades of experience in digital and print media, including stints as a copy desk chief, a wire editor and a metro editor for the McClatchy newspaper chain.\nManaging Editor\n+\nmore\nSoFi Bank's latest card launch may be welcome news for those who make frequent supermarket sweeps.\nThe new $0-annual-fee SoFi Smart Card earns an uncapped 5% cash back at grocery stores, which is among the best rates on the market in one of the biggest spending categories for many shoppers. Technically, you earn 5 SoFi \"reward points\" per $1, but those points are worth 1 cent each. Redemption options include a deposit into a SoFi checking and savings account, a statement credit, or as payment toward any SoFi loans.\nHowever, there are some caveats to be aware of:\nBecause it's a\ncharge card\nand not a credit card, you won\u2019t be able to carry a balance on the SoFi Smart Card and must instead pay it off in full each month.\nSecondly, while the card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee, you must have a SoFi checking and savings account and a SoFi Plus membership, which costs $10 a month. (Your account balances determine your spending limit with the card.) You'd need to spend at least $200 a month at grocery stores using the SoFi Smart Card to earn enough in rewards to offset that membership cost.\nThe card doesn\u2019t earn rewards on any other purchases.\nOn the plus side, there\u2019s no\nhard credit pull\nrequired to apply for the SoFi Smart Card, which protects your credit scores from the temporary dip that can happen from a credit inquiry.\nAnother unique feature of the SoFi Smart Card is how it\u2019s integrated with the cardholder\u2019s checking and savings account to prevent overspending. When a purchase is made with the SoFi Smart Card, the amount of that purchase is \u201creserved,\" meaning those funds are no longer accessible to make other purchases until the card balance is paid.\nIt's similar, in some ways, to how a debit card works. But unlike a debit card, the SoFi Smart Card reports to all\nthree major U.S. credit bureaus\n, so it can help you build your credit.\n\u00bb NEXT:\nNerdWallet's best credit cards for groceries\nAbout the author\nJae Bratton\nJae is a writer for the credit cards team at NerdWallet.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Currently, the card is issued and serviced by Goldman Sachs. The transition is still subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\nIf you\u2019re an existing cardholder, you can expect to be transitioned to the new issuer in about 24 months. What does that entail? Full details aren't yet available, but Chase and Apple offered a glimpse in their recent announcement.\nHere\u2019s what we know:\nMORE:\nSteps to take when your credit card switches issuers\nEarly details\nIf you're an existing holder of the\nApple Card\n, you will not need to reapply for it. During the transition, you can continue to use the card in the same manner. It still earns:\n3% cash back on Apple purchases and\nat select merchants\nlike Nike, Uber, Walgreens and more, when you use the Apple Card with Apple Pay.\n2% cash back on all other purchases when you use the Apple Card with Apple Pay.\n1% cash back on purchases made with the physical Apple Card.\nThe\nApple Card\nwill continue to have no annual fee, no late fees and no foreign transaction fees.\nMastercard\nwill remain the payment network, meaning the card will still be broadly accepted globally.\nYou can keep managing your account in the Wallet app and at\ncard.apple.com\n. If you have a savings account, it will remain accessible. It's also still possible to purchase Apple products with the card\u2019s monthly installments feature when you use it to check out at Apple Store locations and via Apple\u2019s website and app.\nFor customer service inquiries, continue contacting Apple Card support in the Wallet app or at\nsupport.apple.com/apple-card\n.\nStay tuned\nOnce the transition is complete, your balance will be with Chase. If there are any instructions regarding card number changes, physical card changes or other details, they should be provided to you as the transition date approaches.\n\u00bb MORE:\nBenefits of the Apple Card\nAbout the author\nMelissa Lambarena\nMelissa is a credit cards writer at NerdWallet.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

We\u2019ll have a report for you in the near future. For now, check out the press release, which is published below.\n\u2013K.F.\nThe Fliteboard RACE is a competition e-foil.

Here are key things to look for.\nBy\nKevin Falvey\nJanuary 5, 2026\nWhether buying a boat or taking stock of your current boat, an engine-room inspection is required.\nKevin Falvey\nI have been conducting such inspections since my boatyard days (checking out trade-ins, especially) 25 years ago and have continued to do so testing boats for\nBoating\n. However, I was prompted to write this Quick Study after attending Steve D\u2019Antonio\u2019s seminar (\nstevedmarineconsulting.com\n) at last fall\u2019s IBEX trade show. Among many titles, D\u2019Antonio is an American Boat & Yacht Council (ABYC) Master Technician, holding certifications in corrosion, diesel, electrical and systems. This article is not intended to be encyclopedic. It simply serves as a reminder of the importance of engine-room inspections and includes a list of key points to start you off on this key task.\nSafety\nD\u2019Antonio rightly began his presentation with a discussion of safety. Engine and mechanical spaces can be dangerous places. From cuts delivered by unsheathed hose-clamp tails and improperly trimmed zip-ties to the dangers presented by fumes, fuel and electrical systems, care and respect must attend on this job. Wear PPE, including eye protection and gloves. Also, remove jewelry and watches, which can snag in equipment, cause a spark or explosion or weld your wrist to a battery terminal. Turn off battery chargers and gensets beforehand. Remove ignition keys.\nChecking for chafe-protection is important.\nKevin Falvey\nChafe\nRuns of plumbing and electrical wire routed through a boat pass through bulkheads and partitions. In all cases where it might abrade, chafe-protection must be applied. \u201cWire loom buys some time but it is not a permanent solution,\u201d D\u2019Antonio says.\u00a0 That means that the cutout or pass-through is generously padded and the wire or plumbing is secured such that it can\u2019t move or vibrate as it passes through.\nSeacocks\nSeacocks should be accessible. (You may need to stop a leak in a rolling sea.) Make sure the handle is not obstructed by a hose, other equipment or a stringer\u2014we see this on occasion\u2014so that the valve can be closed. Often, a builder will install extension rods to make operating a hard-to-reach seacock-valve lever easier, as the main photo shows.\nDC Electric\nIn testing boats, we too often find batteries with exposed positive terminals. This can cause personal injury, spark or an explosion of the battery itself. Per ABYC standards, the\u00a0 positive battery terminal should be covered to prevent a dropped tool, or a misplaced hand wearing jewelry from causing a spark.\nRead Next:\nInspecting Your Boat After Use\nMany technicians and DIY boaters, such as our own Jim Hendricks, wear a silicon wedding ring. Non-conductive, these will also \u201cbreak away\u201d unlike metal rings, which can deglove a finger if caught in machinery, during a fall, or if a heavy object is dropped. Silicon rings are widely available.\nJim Hendricks\nBelts\nLook for belt dust: fine black speckling. This often indicates that the pulleys are misaligned. Also, look for cracks, frayed edges, glazing, or stretching. Lacking a manual, a rule of thumb for checking belt tension involves depressing your hand on a belt midway between pulleys. If the belt deflects more than \u00bd inch, it\u2019s likely due for replacement.\u00a0 Make sure the engine is cool and the battery is off or disconnected before inspecting belts.\nMotor Mounts\nMotor mounts should be parallel to the centerline of the engine. Also, look for excessive corrosion; the mounts need to remain adjustable as the boat ages. The rubber, or damping material should not be crumbling. Look at the mounting holes: Are any ovoid due to movement? Pros often perform a backdown test, in which the mounts are observed while the engine is placed in reverse and accelerated. Even new mounts can be improperly sized or installed.\nFire Suppression\nMake sure the fire-suppression system is active. D\u2019Antonio says he encounters many in which the system is disabled because the \u201cshipping pin\u201d has not been removed from the manual cable! Another good tip to check: Can the ER smoke alarm be heard at the helm? If not, network it, so that it can be.\nMore:\nboat ownership\n,\nFebruary 2026\n,\nhow to buy a boat\n,\nHow-To\nMore\nHow To\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

Courtesy Florida Film & Tape/Clayton Dodwell\nBoating\u2019s editors test more than 100 boats per year in just about every category. During 2024, our editors once again tested more than 100 boats, including PWC, 16-foot-long runabouts, cruisers, dayboats, and center-console boats in excess of 50 feet length overall.\nEach year, we apply that experience and select the most coveted award in recreational boating: the Boat of the Year (BOTY). Candidates must stand out in the category in which they reside or in the mission they are intended to fulfill. We do not pit a sport-fisher against a wakeboat, for example. Rather, if a wakeboat strikes us as a candidate, we assess how it innovates in that realm. So, the Boat of the Year is the boat that stands out in its category more than any other boat we tested stands out in any other category.\nBoat Test: Monterey Elite 30\nBoat of the Year: Monterey Elite 30\n2024 Monterey Elite 30\n2024 Featured Nominees\nGet a closer look at some of this year\u2019s standout contenders in the field.\nDayboat\u2014Large\nRegal 38 Surf\nFishing\u2014Small\nSailfish 232 Center Console\nDayboat\u2014Small\nMonterey Elite 30\nWatersports\nKYMA K7 Supercharged\nFishing\u2014Large\nNorthCoast 41\nPerformance\nCheckmate Pulsare 2400 BRX\nBoat of the Year: How It Works\nBoating\n\u2019s editors test more than 100 boats per year in just about every category. During 2024, our editors once again tested more than 100 boats, including PWC, 16-foot-long runabouts, cruisers, dayboats, and center-console boats in excess of 50 feet length overall.\nWe tested gas boats, diesel boats, electric boats, jet boats, outboard boats, inboard boats, sterndrive boats and surface-drive boats. We exceeded 150 mph on the water, and we cruised at displacement speeds. V-hull boats represented the lion\u2019s share of our test pool, but we also ran plenty of catamarans in addition to some RIBs, a proa and even a hydrofoil. Coupled with our editors nearly 200 years of combined experience testing boats, this provides the Boating Tech Team with a river of experience that is broad and deep.\nEach year, we apply that experience and select the most coveted award in recreational boating: the Boat of the Year (BOTY).

So, the Boat of the Year is the boat that stands out in its category more than any other boat we tested stands out in any other category.\nWe announce the Boat of the Year winner in January. The six boats here are the 2024 BOTY finalists and themselves represent great boats for the missions in which they serve. Which boat will be the Boat of the Year? Find out in January.\nBoat of the Year: Meet the Judges\nBoating editors test over 100 different boats per year. Boats of all makes, sizes, and types, and with every kind of marine propulsion available. Additionally, our core group of staff editors can claim almost 200 years of combined lifetime boating experience.

Falvey lives with his teenage daughters in East Quogue,NY, where they live the boating life.\nPete McDonald\nExecutive Editor\nPete McDonald is the executive editor of Boating Magazine. He has been involved with the magazine as an editor, boat tester and award-winning writer since 1998 and has contributed to several other Firecrown Media titles, including Yachting, Sport Fishing, and Salt Water Sportsman.

The Pursuit\u2019s meticulous attention to detail is apparent in the orderly rigging and smart placement of service access under the cockpit sole, such as the slide-out shelf for the batteries. These features testify to Pursuit\u2019s commitment to service and ownership tasks.\nFor anglers, the S 388 comes with easily reached rocket launchers, a 36-gallon livewell, and ample rod storage both under the gunwales and on the hardtop.

It\u2019s not that I\u2019m making bad choices. I\u2019m wearing my life jacket. I\u2019m a sober captain. I leave a float plan. But I\u2019m suffering from severe indecision, specifically about naming my boat. And by not naming my boat, according to tradition and legend, I risk incurring the wrath of Neptune. I convinced myself that Neptune was certainly too busy ruling over the Seven Seas to bother with a small lake in the North Woods. But then I did my research, and in the Roman religion, Neptune is the god of the sea and of fresh water. So there you go\u2014Neptune lurks at every launch ramp, checking to see if you\u2019ve cleaned the milfoil off your trailer.\nFaithful readers will recall the time the Lake View Inn gang pestered my good friend Chuck Larson into conducting an elaborate ceremony to rename his new Alumacraft, which involved positioning the boat with the bow facing due north at sunset, reciting a carefully crafted invocation to Neptune\u2014or Njord in this case\u2014and offering a tribute of Hamm\u2019s beer, \u201cFrom the Land of Sky Blue Waters \u2026\u201d. Chuck, of course, took this seriously and now he\u2019s been bugging me about naming my vintage Dunphy, a 14-foot mahogany plywood runabout.\nJust last Friday night Chuck cornered me in a back booth at the Lake View Inn, where I was watching the grandchildren open their pull tabs.\nCultural Interpretation: After our fish fry dinner I buy each grandchild $5 worth of pull tabs. This started as a distraction until one of them won $250, which their father promptly confiscated for the \u201ccollege fund.\u201d And, yes, preschool children do gamble in Northwoods\u2019 taverns so please mind your own business.\nAnyway\u2026Chuck slides into the booth and shares his thoughts.\n\u201cI know the lake is frozen but you\u2019ve got to come up with a name for the Dunphy before next season,\u201d Chuck said, \u201cespecially if you\u2019re taking these beautiful little children out on the water. How could you ever forgive yourself if Neptune decides to cast calamity down from the heavens? Maybe he sends a surf wake to swamp your little boat!\u201d\nI have been trying to come up with a name. There\u2019s some tradition that you name a boat after a wife\u2014but which one?\u2014or a daughter, but I have five of those. Some owners like puns such as\nSeas the Day\nbut does that work on a vintage boat? There are names that allude to a profession, so I could go with\nWriter\u2019s Block\nbut that\u2019s so corny. I asked my wife for an idea and she suggested\nBob\n, which was no help at all. She is only interested in staging the boat with mid-century accessories.\nRead Next:\nInstalling an Illuminated Boat Name\nI have got two ideas I think are pretty good. The first is\nDasher\nbecause for its vintage, this Dunphy has a rather rakish profile, a descending sheer and low freeboard aft. It\u2019s a dashing boat! The second is\nAnalog\n, because there is nothing digital about this boat. It doesn\u2019t even have a key. To shut down the Evinrude outboard I push the choke button on the dash. I could get a little fancy and go with\nAnalogue\nbut that\u2019s a bit pretentious. Save that for the Gar Wood find in a barn.\nSo, will it be\nDasher\nor\nAnalog\n? I asked the grandchildren, and the\u00a0 little 4-year-old looked up from his pull tabs and said, \u201cGrandpa, just name it\nBob\n.\u201d Neptune weeps.\nMore:\nHow-To\n,\nNovember/December 2025\n,\nOff My Dock\nMore\nHow To\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

Most pontoon boats boast outboard power, with some multi-engine models capable of high speeds. Still, simple, modestly powered (and priced) pontoons are available from just about every builder. Still, again, many pontoons now come fitted-out with luxury, rivaling some runabouts in this regard.\n2025 Montara 2.0 23 CWDH\n2025 Sea-Doo Switch Fish 21\n2025 SunChaser Lucerne 20 LR DH\n2025 Sun Tracker Party Barge 20 DLX\n2025 Aura Quad Lounge\n2025 Princecraft Vectra 23 WRL\n2025 G3 SunCatcher Fusion 324 RC\n2025 G3 SunCatcher Select 324 SL\n2025 Bennington 24MSB\n2025 Manitou Cruise 22 Max Switchback\n2025 Viaggio Lago X22Q\n2025 Viaggio Diamante 22S AT\n2025 Helios GT-R 23\n2025 Regency 230 LE3\n2025 Ranger Reata 243C\n2025 Bennington 24 MFB Sport\n2025 Avalon Catalina 2585 Twin Cruise Rear Bench\n2025 Tahoe 2585 Cascade ELW\n2025 Avalon GeoFish CRF\n2025 SunChaser Calais 25 SB DC\n2025 Crest Classic 240 SLSC\n2025 Sylvan M-5 CLZ DC\n2025 Starcraft RX 25 Q DC\n2025 Bennington 25 RX Sport\n2025 Bennington 25QFBA\n2025 Manitou Explore 24 MAX Switchback\n2025 Balise Helix 24\nAdvertisement\nFeatured Videos\nBoat buyers have been relying on\nBoating\n\u2019s boat tests since 1956.

How in the world are these going to be comfortable, or even functional?! Well, if they say to not judge a book by its cover, then I guess it\u2019s fair to say don\u2019t judge sunglasses by their arms\u2026or lack thereof.\nOmbraz\nhave replaced traditional arms with Japanese marine-grade cord. The custom-woven nylon material is abrasion resistant, soft, and 100-percent recycled. Two ergonomic sliders sit at the back of the cord, allowing for quick and easy adjustments to the fit. To wear Ombraz, simply put the cord over your head, place the frames on your face and pull the sliders tight until comfortable. When I received a pair of Ombraz several months ago to test, I was convinced they would feel wobbly or too different to be usable. I was wrong. And many, many wears later, they have become some of my favorite, go-to sunglasses, especially when I\u2019m out on a boat. The frames are well balanced and rest comfortably on my nose, and the design and placement of the cord keeps them in place without hassle.\nRead Next:\nMore Sunglasses Tested\nOf course, the advantages of going armless are many. First and foremost, arms are breakable \u2013 and they are also known to loosen up or stretch out over time, especially for wearers with larger heads. Several of my favorite pairs of sunglasses no longer fit properly or even slip off because they\u2019ve become too loose. By getting rid of the arms and the requisite hinges, Ombraz have eliminated these issues, while simultaneously making their sunglasses more compact and packable. Replacing solid arms with ultra-soft cord removes the problem of ear fatigue. Another advantage to the cord-for-arms system is loss prevention. The cord is a built-in keeper, so you can easily pull the Ombraz off your face and let them hang from your neck.\nThe author, caught here in mid-test of Ombraz sunglasses.\nGarrett Cortese\nThe frames are created with an aerospace-grade TR-90 material that Ombraz claims are indestructible \u2013 even going as far as to back them with a lifetime warranty. The cord and adjustment tabs fall under that lifetime warranty, as well. The Carl Zeiss nylon lenses are scratch and smudge resistant, and Ombraz can be ordered with polarized or non-polarized versions. During testing, the Ombraz I\u2019ve worn with grey polarized lenses are clear, vibrant and great for on-water activities. While the cord-for-arms route requires two hands to properly put on and secure, I appreciate the other advantages and conveniences, especially the packability and durability. While you might have your doubts looking at them, all I can say is you\u2019ve got to try them. I guarantee Ombraz will change the way you think about sunglasses, while enhancing the way you see your world. At $160, they are also cheaper than most other premium eyewear offerings.\nOmbraz can be ordered in five different frame styles (in multiple colorways) with three different lens colors, and side shields can be added for an extra cost. The frames are also offered in regular and XL sizes. For folks with plus-sized heads like myself, this is a wonderful option.\nOmbraz Leggero (XL) w/ grey polarized lenses MSRP: $160,\nombraz.com\nMore:\nGear\n,\nsunglasses\nMore\nGear\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

This new Parker is powered by twin Yamaha engines with a maximum horsepower of 700. We have not yet run this boat, but have decades of experience aboard Parker\u2019s boats. Carolina-bred, its rugged build and hull design couples with the Yamaha propulsion and the Seakeeper Ride system that should deliver confident handling on the water.\nIt offers a self-bailing cockpit, which is a must for any boat on big water in our opinion. Its Coosa board transom won\u2019t rot and the fiberglass liner promises smooth style and easy maintenance. Parker adheres to the strict construction and rigging standards of the American Boat and Yacht Council and the National Marine Manufacturers Association.\nThe broad console features Garmin electronics.\nCourtesy Parker Boats\nThe 294 Fathom offers comfort and elegance on plush bow lounges with backrests. Couple this with the foldaway transom bench, customizable upholstery and perhaps a sun shade, and the 294 Fathom should serve nicely on sandbar days. A head in the console only adds to the comfort and convenience.\nAt the helm, the console features Garmin electronics to help you stay on course and find the fish. Overhead, a fiberglass T-top with powder-coated framework boasts nine rocket launchers, an electronics box, integrated LED spreader lights, speaker pods, LED courtesy lights, and two kingfish rod holders. With options such as a trolling motor or windlass, each 294 Fathom boat can be made unique.\nComfortable seating is found throughout the 294.\nCourtesy Parker Boats\nParker is, as of this writing, offering its boats at what it calls nationally advertised prices (NAP). This is a no-haggle price that you can buy a boat for. Hence, both the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price and NAP are shown above.\nParker, for all its salty tradition, crafted the 294 Fathom with a fresh, modern mindset. This boat blends the beating heart of serious anglers with the desire to create memories with family and friends afloat. If that sounds like you, don\u2019t place a down payment until you have seen this new Parker 294 Fathom.\nA fiberglass T-top with powder-coated framework is outfitted with a plethora of accessories.\nCourtesy Parker Boats\nHigh Points\nT-Top is as fully featured and as well-engineered as you are likely to find aboard a boat of any price.\nSpacious head inside the console provides convenience and comfort whether trolling on the blue water or enjoying a sunset\u00a0 cruise.\nStandard leaning post with armrests, aft-facing seats, rigging table, 22-gallon livewell, and tackle storage.\nThe bow seating is comprised of lounges with backrests that make sandbar days oh-so comfortable.\nFull, bolt-on transom bracket means you get all the boat length you pay for.\nPricing and Specs\nPrice:\n$313,166 (MSRP);\u00a0$238,800 (nationally advertised price)\nLOA:\n32\u20199\u2033 (with engines)\nBeam:\n9\u20195\u2033\nDraft (hull):\n1\u20198\u2033\nDry Weight:\n7,800 lb.\nPersons Capacity:\n12\nFuel Capacity:\n191 gal.\nAvailable Power:\nTwin Yamaha 250, 300, or 350 hp\nContact Parker\nParker Boats\n\u2013 Beaufort, North Carolina;\nparkerboats.com\nMore:\n2026 Boat Buyers Guide\n,\n2026 Boat Buyers Guide Fishing Boats\n,\nboat tests\n,\nBoats\n,\nFishing Boats\n,\nParker Boats\nMore\nBoats\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

With a manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price ranging from $195,000 to $235,000, it targets experienced boaters seeking a higher-quality build.\nConstruction is a key highlight, featuring a vacuum-infused composite hull with Kevlar reinforcement for lightweight strength. The builder utilizes a High-Pressure Injection closed-cell foam core, which is injected while the hull and liner are still in the molds. This process creates an unsinkable hull that eliminates hollow voids, reduces noise, and provides a sturdier ride in rough water. The design incorporates a stepped hull for increased efficiency and speed, along with a deep Carolina flare at the bow.\nThe helm can be equipped with joystick controls, an autopilot, and twin Garmin MFDs up to 16 inches.\nCourtesy American Marine Sports\nPowered by options up to twin 350 hp outboards, the boat can hit a top end exceeding 70 mph with a typical crew and gear load. The helm can be equipped with joystick controls, an autopilot, and twin Garmin MFDs up to 16 inches. A newer upgrade includes a glass enclosure integrated into the hardtop\u2019s D-channel tubing, freeing up walkway space.\nFor anglers, the 270 SS Open offers expansive casting decks and four tournament livewells, including a 35-gallon tank at the helm station, allowing for the separation of bait species. Features include under-gunwale rod storage, eight stainless-steel flush-mount rod holders, and both raw- and freshwater washdowns.\nThere\u2019s a 35-gallon tank at the helm station.\nCourtesy American Marine Sports\nFamily amenities are integrated without compromising fishability. The layout includes convertible seating with reclining lounges, a fold-down aft bench, and a large forward lounge over an insulated fish box.

Hood 32, an elegant daysailer with the graceful lines of an International One-Design and the speed of a competitive racer.\n\u201cI wanted the boat to be drop-dead gorgeous and sail as good as it looks,\u201d said Hood, 57, who in 2009 saw himself in a dream, sitting by the big bay window in his kitchen while holding up a model sailboat in one hand. The sleek little boat with long overhangs was spinning gracefully, riveting his attention.\n\u201cI knew that was the shape I wanted. That was the vision, so I modeled the 32 after what I thought I saw,\u201d he said.\nFrom the dream came the first set of drawings, a collaboration by Hood and Ben Stoddard, then a member of the C.W. Hood Yachts design team in Marblehead, Massachusetts.\nChris Hood takes a break from building Hull No. 41 of his C.W. Hood 32.\nDesigning a boat is one challenge, building it another, but as often happens, marketing and sales proved the most difficult hurdle. Hood was about to invest in constructing a high-end daysailer at a time when competition among boatbuilders offering daysailers was fierce. It was a niche market that included companies like Alerion, Morris,Tartan and Hinckley. A few naysayers advised Hood to drop the idea, but he was determined. Such tenacity was not surprising, considering Hood grew up under the mentorship of his father, Bruce Hood, a talented chemical engineer for whom no project was undoable, and his uncle Ted Hood, the legendary yachtsman, designer, builder and sailmaker who captained the winner of the 1974 America\u2019s Cup.\n\u201cThe Alerion 28 started it all and quickly became very popular. When I decided to try this, Morris and Tartan were already building daysailers, and Hinckley had made one as well,\u201d Hood said. \u201cEveryone was jumping on the bandwagon.\u201d\nHood was convinced he could design and build a daysailer that would stand out from the others.\n\u201cI wanted something different. I wanted to go back to the days of daysailing in a boat that was elegant, comfortable and just happens to sail well. And I wanted it to look like an IOD but sail like a laser,\u201d he said.\nHood already knew plenty about IODs. In the mid-1990s his company was awarded a contract to construct IOD-class boats and he built 18.\nHood\u2019s goal was to build as pure a sailboat as possible, one meant for those who are out on the water to relish the joy of sailing without the burdensome weight and equipment found aboard cruising boats. The daysailer would be outfitted with a mast, rudder, self-tacking jib, quality sails and an electric motor, but without bunks, galley, winches and a head. As a result, it would weigh only 2,800 pounds, making it highly maneuverable and require little wind to get up and go.\n\u201cThe 32 can actually turn on its own length,\u201d Hood said, while seated in his modest office that\u2019s tucked in a rustic, historic building constructed in the late 1800s and long known as the home of the former Graves Boatyard.\nBefore moving forward with actual production, Hood consulted with longtime friend Bruce Dyson, a Marblehead resident, respected skipper and master craftsman known as \u201cthe IOD Whisperer\u201d for his efforts to rescue and restore\u00a0vintage sailboats.\nHappy sailors take a 32 for a spin.\n\u201cI asked Bruce if he\u2019d take a look at the design. He told me to send it over and he\u2019d get back to me in a few days,\u201d Hood said.\nAn hour after receiving the drawing, Dyson was on the phone with Hood, enthusiastically explaining that the design was inspiring and that he\u2019d be coming right over to the to discuss it. Dyson said he would be bringing along Frank Morse, an old friend and\u00a0\u00a0Marblehead sailor who just happened to be in the market for a new boat.\nHood recalled how Morse came straight to the point.\n\u201cFrank asked me, \u2018You going to build it?\u2019 And I said, yes, if I\u2019ve got a customer. That\u2019s when Frank looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m your customer.\u2019 So all of this became possible because of that one man, Frank Morse.\u201d\nWhen Hood suggested Morse come up with a name for the boat, the sailor answered with one word\u00a0Dream\u00a0because he couldn\u2019t have dreamed of a better boat. Morse has since passed away, but his son Christopher Morse continues to sail hull No. 1.\nSoon after Frank Morse lent his support, Marblehead resident Tom McManus contracted for hull No. 2, which was followed by another order from a Seattle sailor for hull No. 3. Morse\u2019s boat debuted in 2011. As word spread, sailor Marc van den Kuur purchased hull No. 6 to sail in Holland. The orders continued to arrive, slowly but steadily as a dozen years ticked by. Hugo Salinas Price purchased hull No. 16, which he sails in Acapulco, Mexico. Then came a purchase order that gave the Hood 32 an unprecedented boost. America\u2019s Cup tactician and sailing television commentator Gary Jobson took claim to hull No. 17 and named it\nWhirlwind\n.\nThe 32-foot daysailer comes together in the shop in Marblehead, Massachusetts.\n\u201cThese days, I sail it on average once a week. It\u2019s on a hoist so I can sail whenever I like,\u201d said Jobson, whose home port is Annapolis, Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s not an overnight cruiser and it\u2019s not a race boat. It\u2019s just perfect for two or three people to fit comfortably.\u201d\nJobson took ownership of his Hood 32 in 2015.\n\u201cI just love the way the boat sails. It\u2019s a rocket ship downwind,\u201d he said. \u201cI typically use the boat for short sails, two to four hours, with one or two people coming aboard. It makes for good, long conversation. Or else I do a longer sail, five to eight hours, and stop along the way for lunch.\u201d\nLike other Hood 32 owners, Jobson appreciates the boat\u2019s simple, no-fuss design, which makes it easy to spontaneously decide to go for an hour sail.\nHood replaced the earlier battery-powered motor in Jobson\u2019s boat with a different model after some discussion. The first in a series of electric motors powered by lithium batteries had been introduced in the Hood 32 in 2012. Buyers were given the option of an electric outboard motor called the Torqueedo, which is clamped to the hull, or the Mastervolt PODMaster sail-drive propulsion system that took up space inside the boat.\n\u201cMy boat has a prop that feathers. It\u2019s not a folding prop. If you turn the motor on, the prop spins as you\u2019re sailing so you can charge up the battery,\u201d Jobson said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great feature.\u201d\nAt the U.S. Naval Academy graduation in Annapolis in May, Jobson flew his spinnaker and tacked amid hundreds of boats during a lull in the ceremony while awaiting the Blue Angels show team flyover.\n\u201cEveryone from that fleet of boats was cheering us on because there we were, tacking our way through them with the spinnaker flying,\u201d he said. The maneuver generated plenty of excitement over the nimble daysailer.\nTwenty-four more Hood 32s were built after Jobson\u2019s\nWhirlwind\nand four others are currently on order, bringing the total number of hulls to 45.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building hull No. 41 right now,\u201d said Desmond Binger, a craftsman and mechanic who has been building boats at C.W. Hood Yachts for the past 22 years, hand-laying the fiberglass hull, monitoring the infusion process, and participating in the woodwork finish. \u201cThese are fine boats.

He installed it as part of the other instrumentation, in a way so that there aren\u2019t different electronics and separate keypad controls all over the cockpit. I also have the electric motor in mine, so I don\u2019t worry about the doldrums that can sweep in here.\u201d\nPfeifer opted for the carbon fiber mast and rudder combination, the GPS and several other upgrades.\n\u201cI wanted something elegant but with modern performance,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore this boat, I was with the IOD circuit, then the J/24s, the 505s, the J/105s, and there was a J/22 in there someplace before I bought a J/100. But this boat fits the bill.\u201d\nJim Issler and his wife, Heather Jeltes, are equally enthralled with their daysailer.\n\u201cWhen we first saw that boat sail by, we fell it love with it,\u201d said Jeltes, recalling they stopped to have a closer look while heading along the dock to the yacht club. \u201cThe next day, Jim ordered the boat.\u201d\nThe Connecticut couple previously owned two smaller boats\u2014 a Marshall Sandpiper catboat and a Buzzards Bay 14.\n\u201cSo unlike many, my sailboats are getting bigger. That being said, we get so many compliments on the boat. There are many experienced sailors considering down-sizing to the Hood 32,\u201d Jeltes said.\nJeltes enjoys singlehanding\nUccello III\n, which she finds easier to sail compared to their previous boats.\n\u201cIn the beginning I was a bit trepidatious, but I immediately found she was a beauty to handle in all winds. I so love the boat.\u201d\nDavid Daigle sails his 2020 Hood 32\nSwitchbac\nk\u00a0out of the Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich, Connecticut, currently homeport to three of the daysailers.\n\u201cThis is only our second sailboat as we have mostly owned powerboats.\u00a0When we bought\u00a0Switchback, we owned a 50-foot Grand Banks Eastbay that we used for cruising, so we wanted a daysailer that we could sail from our club with ease.\u201d\nWhile the boat can be singlehanded the cockpit is just as comfortable with six, he said.\n\u201cWe love the low freeboard and how close to the water you feel when sailing.\u201d\nThe three Hood 32 owners in Greenwich have raced at the club and are talking about a larger regatta.\nSmall fleets of Hood 32s have emerged in Newport, Rhode Island, and in Connecticut along the shores of western Long Island Sound. Other have loosely assembled in Maine, and while these fleets may not currently engage in frequent racing, owners are already talking about organizing a regatta. Most Hood 32 owners are age 60 and older.\nThe price of a new Hood 32 typically ranges from $150,000 to $165,000, depending on customizations such as a carbon mast and advanced electronics. Only one pre-owned model was for sale during spring 2023 with an asking price of $85,000.\n\u201cMost of the boats get passed along by word of mouth and never come on the market,\u201d Hood said.\nAlthough the boat is built without a head, causing some consternation among those who might be out on the water for longer than the prescribed four-hour sail, owners have tested some options.\nJobson lashed a portable toilet aboard for five years but claimed nobody ever used it. He has since tried a plastic-coated steel bucket contraption, but again said it goes unused.\nRuminating on the success of the Hood 32 while celebrating the milestone of hull No. 45, Hood looks back fondly on his Marblehead childhood that included plenty of messing around with boats.\n\u201cGrowing up, I had a Widgeon when I was seven or eight years old. But my favorite was the IOD, which I rebuilt with my dad when I was about 13,\u201d he said.\nThat was about the same time he built a tender and christened it Ocean 1. The tender with its simple design packed some surprising features for its time, including injection-molded construction, self-bailing cockpit and roller reefing.\n\u201cBetween my father and uncle, we were always doing something around boats. Every waking moment was on the boat if the weather was good. I still remember there were tools everywhere, in the cellar, in the garage, starting with my grandfather, Ralph, who would always say, \u2018If it\u2019s broken, we\u2019ll fix it.\u2019 My father had the same old-Yankee attitude and he could fix or make just about anything. He once wanted a new autopilot for his boat, but he only bought the compass and did the rest of it himself,\u201d Hood said.\nA father of three grown children with his wife, Nancy, Hood showed similar talent as a young man. He had studied architecture but lacked formal training in boat design or construction. The first boat he built outside his childhood and teenage projects was a 24-foot Cape Dory trawler. His uncle Ted had acquired Cape Dory molds in the late 1990s.\n\u201cAll of the Cape Dory boats were built so well. That\u2019s why so many of them are still out there,\u201d Hood said.\nTed Hood also gave his nephew the mold for the Wauquiez 26 powerboat, which was another turning point in the younger Hood\u2019s professional career. \u201cWe built 45 of them,\u201d he said.\nHood was building power boats shortly before taking on the daysailer project. He and his staff had spent a year building a 43-footer.\n\u201cWe were just finishing up. Things were coming to an end,\u201d he said, describing the alarm he felt at facing a clean slate. \u201cI remember saying to myself, when this is done we won\u2019t have anything to do.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when the Hood 32 entered his sphere and the dream became reality.\n\u201cIf a boat is beautiful, you won\u2019t forget it,\u201d Hood said.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Features\nThey just did it\nWhat to do when it goes bang\nNew Boats for 2025\nBreaking the fiberglass ceiling\nHove to in the gales of Biscay\nCruising at the bottom of the world\nSpring Boat Show Time\nSailing into no man's land\nSerious fun on and off the water\nSpring spruce-up\nAlso from David Liscio\nBeneteau 393\nAlerion Express 28\nC&C 37/40\nRig tuning\nHow to optimize for shorthanded sailing\nCabo Rico 38\nBargin Boats to Sail Now\nHunter Vision 32\nChasing a dream\nThe wide, wide world of multihulls\nSubscribe\nFollow Us\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to get the latest from SAILING Magazine delivered via email.\nEmail Address\n*\nEmail Format\nhtml\ntext\n*\nindicates required\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nPowered by\nWEHAA.COM\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Sailing Magazine, All rights reserved.\nClose\nClose\nClose",

It\u2019s not difficult know when you need new sails or the paint job and brightwork need attention. But figuring out if a battery upgrade is necessary and how to do it is at times less obvious. Odds are, though, that if the house batteries are more than five years old, you are going to want to think about replacing them. Wet-cell lead acid batteries have a life span of about five years. Some can be coaxed to perform longer, but their performance will degrade over time.\u00a0If you\u2019ve found that you are constantly charging the batteries or can\u2019t run many of the systems you\u2019d like to for long periods, it may be worth considering a battery upgrade as well.\nBoat Test\n2017 January 1 - 12:00 am\nPowerful passagemaker\nWith sleek, modern looks this cruiser is kitted out for long voyages at a quick pace\nBy\nRichard Reichelsdorfer\nAt first glance, the 54 is an impressive boat.

We are figuring out the sail but continue to struggle with one aspect. We fly the sail from a block mounted on the anchor roller. This setup is working pretty well, but we have torn the bow light off the pulpit twice. The sail can get away from us, and then the tack line whips around and snags on the bow light. How do we fix this?\nFrank Davis\nNewport News, Virginia\nDear Frank,\nI have been there! Sometimes you are happily sailing along, but a shift results in chaos. Even worse, you hoist in a light breeze and find things building to \u201clet God take it down\u201d conditions. Flying the sail inside your pulpit when you don\u2019t have 100% control can get messy. I have two ideas for you.\nThe best answer is a gennaker sprit, which allows you to tack the sail a bit forward of the pulpit, clear of most everything. Your sail will fly in cleaner air, and you\u2019ll have room to jibe it \u201cinside.\u201d It takes some work to fit a sprit, but is very doable. Both Selden and Sparcraft/Facnor make kits to retrofit onto many boats. The systems typically integrate into the anchor roller. A collar supports the sprit at the anchor roller, and the sprint affixes to the deck on the aft end. They are removable and typically don\u2019t require a bobstay or supporting rigging.\nAn easier but less functional option is to fix the spinnaker\u2019s tack to (or near) the furled jib. This is traditionally done with parrel beads, a set of wood or plastic beads strung on a piece of wire or cordage. The string of beads is looped around the furled headsail, and the free ends are attached to the spinnaker\u2019s tack. The beads allow the tack to float up and down, but prevents it from whipping around when things get dicey.\nThere are modern options to parrel beads, the most popular is the ATN Tacker (www.atninc.com). The Tacker performs the same job as parrel beads, but its wide, slippery cuff slides more easily on the furled sail.\nFixing the tack limits the agility of the sail. It doesn\u2019t affect reaching, but it limits the rotation of the sail when going downwind. The beads can\u2019t be installed until the sail is furled, and the sail can\u2019t be unfurled until the beads are removed. For a typical cruising sailor, these limits are acceptable, but racers would likely balk.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Boat Doctor\nTake care of your prop and it will take care of you\nHow do I connect solar panels?\nShould I ditch the hanks for a roller furler?\nCan I drop in lithium batteries?\nWhy won\u2019t my holding tank pump out?\nWhich way is better: Erie Canal or  the St. Lawrence?\nHow do I prepare for a new boat delivery?\nHow do I replace leaking hatches?\nHow do I stop my mast from leaking?\nHow should I rig a preventer?\nAlso from Bob Pingel\nTake care of your prop and it will take care of you\nDiesel engine care\nHow do I connect solar panels?\nOptimizing shore power\nShould I ditch the hanks for a roller furler?\nCan I drop in lithium batteries?\nWhy won\u2019t my holding tank pump out?\nWhich way is better: Erie Canal or  the St. Lawrence?\nHow do I prepare for a new boat delivery?\nThe knots you need to know\nSubscribe\nFollow Us\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to get the latest from SAILING Magazine delivered via email.\nEmail Address\n*\nEmail Format\nhtml\ntext\n*\nindicates required\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nPowered by\nWEHAA.COM\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Sailing Magazine, All rights reserved.\nClose\nClose\nClose",

We were off the Lycian coast of Turkey. My wife Tadji was at the helm, searching for zephyrs as\nQuetzal\nghosted over a shimmering sea. I was below, rummaging through the nav station looking for a detailed chart for the approach to Kekova Roads. I am a luddite, I still use paper charts and I knew it was in there somewhere. Picking through my well-used Imray Mediterranean charts I couldn\u2019t find it. Then I stumbled upon a few neatly folded old Turkish charts. In the upper left-hand corner I saw my mother\u2019s unmistakable script, \u201cKAS \u2013 CAVUS BURNU \u2013 TURKEY.\u201d She always wrote in caps. I had forgotten that I had tossed some charts from her around-the-world voyage aboard before my last Atlantic crossing.\nScaled at 1:100,000 it wasn\u2019t the detail I was hoping for but it didn\u2019t matter. I lost all interest in our approach. Tadji would have to use the chartplotter to con her way into the harbor as I had retreated several decades into the past. I studied Mom\u2019s penciled course line duly noted as 268 degrees true, and the position fixes scribbled in her hand and her sailing partner Tim\u2019s. I knew that they had sailed this coast many years before and I tried to reconstruct their route aboard\nEpoch\n, their 37-foot sloop. They must have left Antalya the night before as the chart showed morning fixes at 0737, 0842, and the last one, at 1029 in the outer approaches to the same anchorage for which we were heading. They had taken bearings off landmarks and furrowed headlands, a voyage from an earlier era before GPS conquered the world. The chart was printed in 1978. They were sailing in June of 1986, the third year of a near circumnavigation. Tadji and I were about to share their anchorage in July 2013. Not for the first time I realized that the world is indeed round and that I have been sailing in circles for almost four decades. I closed my eyes and pictured\nEpoch\nand\nQuetzal\nanchored together. I found more than my mother\u2019s handwriting on that old chart, I found her spirit too and I wasn\u2019t letting go easily.\nI poured over the other Turkish charts I had aboard, following\nEpoch\nas she made her way up the coast, reliving her voyage as she called at Marmaris, Bodrum and a host of Greek islands before deciding to winter over in Kusadasi, Turkey.\nEpoch\nwas an unorthodox cruising boat back then, a Jeanneau Gin Fizz with a flat bottom, jaunty fin keel and partial skeg rudder. But Mom and Tim loved her and she never let them down as they rode the prevailing winds\nacross the Pacific and Indian oceans. I could see her clearly as I\ncontinued to time travel; an Aires self-steering vane on the stern, a full dodger and bimini top, and an interior crammed with mementos from their travels, including a globe suspended by fishing line with a tape line showing their route. Sadly their voyage would end the next year when Tim died suddenly from a stealthy brain aneurysm.\nSailing off the coast of Turkey, Kretschmer found his mother's chart of the area in the nav desk of his boat and realized she'd sailed the same waters many years before.\nIn 1986 I was making my living as a delivery skipper and finding my way as a writer. I had written a book about our voyage around Cape Horn in a diminutive Contessa 32 named\nGigi\n. And I sold my first piece, a less than scintillating treatise about local winds of the world, to\nSAILING\nMagazine. I was thrilled when then-editor Micca Hutchins agreed to buy it and it was published in April of 1987, the first of many pieces by this writer sandwiched between the\nmagazine\u2019s oversized covers. No I haven\u2019t been there for all 50\nyears, but for the last three decades\nSAILING\nhas provided a wonderful\nplatform where I\u2019ve chronicled my wanderings and watery misadventures. A homeport if you will, for an itinerant sailor and writer.\nAs more and more miles sluice beneath my keel I find myself connecting the dots of a peripatetic life, crossing wakes with early voyages and contrasting long ago landfalls with more recent ones. Last year Quetzal and her crew anchored off the Caribbean island of Montserrat. Once a lush paradise, the island was rocked by a series of volcanic eruptions beginning in 1995 and continuing through 2010.\u00a0The former capitol of Plymouth was buried and the entire southern half of the island was covered in ash, an eerie moonscape that we explored by land and sea. What a difference from my first visit to Montserrat 32 years before.\nI was a young captain delivering a spanking new Contessa 32 with her owner, Ty Techera, from England to Antigua. It was my first big job, my first Atlantic crossing, and I was nervous. It was mid-November when we finally set off and we endured a stormy christening voyage battling one gale after another as we clawed our way out of the channel and across the Bay of Biscay. We were both exhausted as the waters calmed off the coast of Portugal and we decided to call at Lisbon for a well-deserved break. As it became clear we would not make the approach in daylight, I announced that we would heave-to for the night. Ty, who was dreaming of a hot shower, a stable hotel bed and a steak dinner ashore, was not pleased. He questioned my judgment, always fair game. But then he questioned my navigation, and that was out of bounds.\n\u201cHow do you know we are where you say we are?\u201d he chided me. \u201cLisbon is supposed to be a big city and I don\u2019t see any lights on the horizon.\u201d\n\u201cShut up Ty,\u201d I blurted back, \u201cand don\u2019t question my navigation.\u201d I had met Ty at a celestial navigation class I was conducting and was proud of my sextant skills. Some things were sacred.\nThe next morning we made our way into Lisbon and enjoyed a couple of days of rest and recuperation. Then we set off for the new world. We called at the Canary Islands and then let the northeast trades propel us across the pond. For two weeks we sailed with just a poled-out headsail running before steady breezes, reeling off 150 miles every 24 hours. As we approached Antigua the skies turned leaden and the wind increased to near gale force. I began to fret. I searched the sky for a glimpse of the sun, star sights were out of the question. I was unsure of our position, a dark concern I kept to myself. On New Year\u2019s Eve I reckoned that we should have been right on top of Antigua but no land was in sight. All through the long night we listened for breaking surf and peered into the abyss ahead. I was beginning to worry that I had managed to miss the entire Caribbean chain when Ty spied land at first light.\nThen and now, Kretsch is never far from a sextant.\nVerdant mountains were visible above the clouds, we were just a few miles offshore and were soon in the lee along the south coast. We were exultant, we felt like next of kin to old Chris Columbus. Ty prepared breakfast and I dug out the harbor chart for English Harbor and tried to pinpoint our position for landfall. But I couldn\u2019t match the island\u2019s topography with the chart. Something was wrong. Desperate, I motored toward a small fishing skiff and sheepishly cried out, \u201cWhere\u2019s English Harbor?\u201d Just as Ty popped into the cockpit the fisherman replied in a booming voice. \u201cEnglish Harbor? That\u2019s Antigua man, dis is Montserrat, Antigua is 30 miles over there.\u201d Ty looked at me and with a villainous grin and asked, \u201cShould I question your navigation?\u201d\nGigi\nwas the perfect boat for a kid from the suburbs masquerading as an old salt. The fact that we sailed her to the bottom of the world and back via Cape Horn still surprises me.\nGigi\ndeserves the credit, she was forgiving and capable and looking back from the perspective of a million waves later, I find myself still applying the lessons she taught me and remembering the adventures we shared. These days I conduct offshore training passages aboard\nQuetzal\n, a Kaufman 47 that in some design aspects is an oversized Contessa 32. One of our rites of autumn is the heavy weather passage from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean, a challenging passage that has provided the crew of\nQuetzal\nsome interesting adventures, including a near catastrophic broach, a savage knockdown and the joy of weathering several serious gales.\nA few years ago we raced an approaching nor\u2019easter across the Gulf Stream and beat the blow by 24 hours. We endured 40-knot winds and occasional storm-force gusts, but the conditions were manageable. Sadly the same cannot be said for a Canadian solo sailor just two days behind us. Herbert Marcoux, an accomplished voyager who had circumnavigated in his 46-foot steel boat, sailed into the heart of the building fury. The Coast Guard reported winds of 60 knots and seas more than 10 meters as the wind and current locked horns in mortal combat. Like us, Marcoux was bound for Bermuda, but he never arrived.\nThe past and present collided a few days later. We cleared Bermuda on October 30 and on November 1 crossed the very spot on the chart where 25 years before Gigi had been capsized early on during the first leg of her Cape Horn voyage. Alone on watch, warm and dry tucked behind the dodger, I recalled that particularly ugly night. We had been battling what we later learned was a tropical storm, forereaching southeast under triple-reefed main and storm staysail. As darkness swallowed the boat, my shipmate Molly and I were weary, soaked to the core and more than a little scared, as the storm seemed never ending. I decided to drop the staysail to ease the motion in the meager hope that we might be able to get some sleep.\nKretschmer's Contessa 32 inspired the book Cape Horn to Starboard, the story of the boat's rounding the\nI heard the wave before I saw it. It crested with a throaty roar before violently breaking across the boat amidships. Reflexively I dove for the companionway but Gigi went over like a toy in a bathtub. I clutched the mainsheet and felt myself pulled underwater in a torrent of frothy ocean. The seconds seemed to freeze, I can remember clearly to this day the odd sensation that I was suddenly\nswimming. It seemed like I was underwater a long time.\nTethered to the boat I came up as\nGigi\nrighted herself and I managed to drag myself aboard over the crushed lifelines.\nBack in the cockpit I cried out for Molly. She was below and had rolled from her bunk to the headliner and back to her bunk. Miraculously, despite a bevy of flying interior items, she was unhurt. Then I surveyed our shattered world. The main was shredded, the steering vane ripped away, the stations and lifelines crushed, the dodger flattened but the mast was still standing and we were upright. We had survived.\nGigi\nseemed embarrassed, as if she\u2019d let her proud pedigree down by being capsized, and was chafing for me to get her moving again.\nThe lesson was painfully obvious to even a dim-witted skipper, slowing the boat to a wallowing crawl had been a terrible mistake. If we had continued to forereach or if we had properly hove-to we would have been spared the drama and I would not have come within a razor\u2019s breath of vanishing with the waves to await the arrival of Herbert Marcoux. The terrifying experience of that night coalesced into one of my fundamental tenets for staying afloat and alive. Many miles and many storms later I am here to report that keeping moving is always a good thing.\nGigi\nand I continued to cross wakes, the intersection of one another on old, out-of-date charts and in the planning of future voyages. Last summer, when I was removing\nQuetza\nl\u2019s tired teak decks at my sister\u2019s boatyard in Solomon\u2019s, Maryland, my brother-in-law Trevor and I realized how close we had come to encountering each other in the Pacific 30 years ago. He was singlehanding around the world in his 37-foot cutter Wandering Star and had transited the Panama Canal bound for the Marquesas. I had rounded the Horn and was on the homeward leg to San Francisco. Reading Trevor\u2019s old logbook we discovered that we had crossed tracks just a few hundred miles apart. A few months later in Australia he would meet my mom and Tim aboard\nEpoch\n, and then later, my sister Liz when she flew out for a visit. Her short holiday turned into a lifetime together as she signed aboard\nWandering Star\nand as Trevor jokes, \u201cnever left.\u201d\nThis summer I will join Francois Mousset,\nGigi\n\u2019s new owner in Scotland. Francois purchased the restored\nGigi\nseveral years ago. We became friends and shipmates when he sailed aboard\nQuetzal\nin Nova Scotia a few years ago. I am looking forward to taking Gigi\u2019s tiller again, the first time in 32 years as we head to St. Kilda in the Outer Hebrides.\nFrom Cape Horn to pristine waters of the north, I keep making discoveries that connect voyages of the past with those of the present. I first visited Newfoundland in 1994 joining my friend Peter Cook aboard his stubby motorsailer for an adventure along the rugged south shore, a cruise like so many others, chronicled in Sailing. I was enchanted by the Rock, as Newfoundlanders call their island, and soon after buying Quetzal, I pointed the bow north. We have sailed to Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador several times and this past summer explored the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In the Bras d\u2019 Or lakes of Cape Breton, a protected enclave of islands and coves in an otherwise harsh environment, I met Henry Fuller. His quaint Cape Breton Boatyard in Baddeck has long been a waypoint for sailors heading out or returning from northern voyages. Henry, a living encyclopedia of small boat voyaging, is a friend to all sailors and we realized we had a mutual friend.\nKretschmer's mother's boat Epoch sailed much of the world, although Kretsch didn't seem to be too worried about that in this classic photo.\nI met Trevor Robertson in that fateful year of 1986. I was helping to deliver\nEpoch\nfrom Sri Lanka to Cyprus via the Arabian and Red Seas when we inadvertently sailed into a rapidly escalating coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in what was then the South Yemenis port of Aden. Several cruising yachts were anchored in the inner harbor as a civil war erupted around them. The navy and air force were trying to overthrow the socialist government while the army remained loyal. Gunboats lobbed shells ashore and fighter jets strafed the beach. The army launched heavy artillery out at the gunboats. The yachts were trapped between the deadly barrages.\nWe were anchored in the outer harbor and had a front row seat for this harrowing exchange. Trevor was aboard his 30-foot sloop\nSalvation Jane\nin the inner harbor. When a yacht with the unfortunate name of Innocent Bystander was shelled everything changed. A nearby Russian freighter put out an urgent radio message. They would accept yacht crews for the next 15 minutes, then they were leaving. The crews had no choice but to abandon their boats. We were the only yacht in a position to make a run for it and followed the Russian ship out of the harbor. After surviving a terrifying encounter with a gunboat we made all speed to the west and watched Aden burn through the night.\nA devotee of celestial navigation, Kretschmer still has the plotting worksheet for Gigi's rounding of Cape Horn in 1984.\nWe found our way to Djibouti, a small country in the horn of Africa squeezed between Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Word of the war, which claimed 10,000 lives, had spread quickly and the harbor was gripped with fear. The Russian ship dropped her yacht refuges in Djibouti who were desperate for news of their boats and for a place to sleep. Trevor stayed with us. He was determined to get back to Aden and retrieve his boat. After a week the hostilities subsided, the government survived, and we decided to head north for Suez. I urged Trevor to sail with us but instead he made arrangements for a fishing boat to take him back to Yemen. They dropped him 20 miles from Aden. In a leaking small boat, under the cover of darkness, he made his way back into the harbor. It was foul with oil and the debris of war but he found\nSalvation Jane\nafloat and managed to sail her out to sea and eventually to the Mediterranean. She was the only other boat to get out of Aden.\nWe corresponded for a while but eventually lost touch as we both continued to crisscross the globe under sail. Trevor built a 35-foot gaff-rigged steel cutter in Australia and sailed singlehanded around Cape Horn before wintering in the Antarctic. After breaking out of the ice he sailed north to Baddeck, where he and Annie Hill, another well-known sailor and author, were married in Henry Fuller\u2019s boatyard. The new couple then sailed to Greenland and wintered over. Trevor and Annie were awarded the Cruising Club of America\u2019s Blue Water Medal in 2009 and he is thought to be the only sailor to have spent winters frozen in the Arctic and Antarctic.\nThrough Henry, Trevor and I reconnected by email and realized\nthat we had just missed each other in Labrador last summer. Henry\nwas hopeful that\nIron Bark\nand\nQuetzal\nmight rendezvous at his boatyard last fall but Trevor opted to sail direct from Newfoundland to Australia, he\u2019s en route now. I am sure our paths will cross again.\nIn the last 13 years, sailors from all over the world have joined me aboard\nQuetzal\nand we\u2019ve logged more than 100,000 miles. One passage has followed another, six times across the Atlantic and numerous Caribbean and Mediterranean odysseys. Ostensibly I teach voyaging skills, and maybe I do, but it seems Aristotle is more influential than the Annapolis Book of Seamanship. There\u2019s humanity about our voyages, a sense of shared adventure, freedom and responsibility that is elusive and just plain hard to find ashore. A small boat, under press of sail, surrounded by steel blue waves, seems the perfect environment to unleash eudaimonia, Aristotle\u2019s word for the good life, or better put, for human flourishing.\nMore and more these day I find former shipmates in far flung harbors who have purchased boats and taken to the sailing life. From the lagoon at Bora Bora, to the roadstead off Santa Cruz in the Galapagos, to the marina in Corfu to many anchorages in the Caribbean, I\u2019ve heard the call of \u201cHey\nQuetzal\n\u201d and I confess to feeling a bit of pride that in some small way I was helpful in launching their dreams.\nSome might argue that my lifetime of wanderings are more of an abstract collection of rhumblines, a post-modern painting of a man addicted to pressing on. I disagree. Every time I cast off the lines and head for the uncluttered horizon I know that I am not only on a mission to collect more material for Sailing Magazine articles but sailing a great circle route, the shortest distance between confines ashore and the good life waiting at sea.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Features\nThey just did it\nWhat to do when it goes bang\nNew Boats for 2025\nBreaking the fiberglass ceiling\nBuilding a dream\nHove to in the gales of Biscay\nCruising at the bottom of the world\nSpring Boat Show Time\nSailing into no man's land\nSerious fun on and off the water\nAlso from John Kretschmer\nHove to in the gales of Biscay\nSailing's Promise\nPassage to nowhere\nFarewell to brothers of the sea\nPlotting a course to Caribbean sabbatical cruise\nPassage Planning\nReady to Rumble\nGood vibrations\nLaunching and boarding a life raft\nA modern thoroughbred\nSubscribe\nFollow Us\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to get the latest from SAILING Magazine delivered via email.\nEmail Address\n*\nEmail Format\nhtml\ntext\n*\nindicates required\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nPowered by\nWEHAA.COM\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Sailing Magazine, All rights reserved.\nClose\nClose\nClose",

That trickle-down feature from racers to cruisers has been a boon to sailboat designers because it increases the interior volume, allowing for more cruising gear and features inside the boat and more space in the cockpit.

Perry\nTraditional catboat daysailer with modern twists\nGarry Hoyt and the Alerion team bring us this updated version of the traditional Cape Cod catboat. Catboats are older than Bill Wyman and may be an acquired taste. Certainly the styling, with its snubbed-off ends and superbroad transom, gives the catboat its distinct look. However, we are seeing more boats today with minimal overhangs and broad sterns, so the catboat does not look as foreign as it did to me in the early '60s.\nGarry Hoyt can't leave anything alone. The catboat came with a number of genetic weaknesses or \"personal idiosyncracies\" and Garry attacked these with his typical innovative attitude. Catboats have too much weather helm. Catboats don't go to weather. The solution to this was to renovate the rig using a free-standing, carbon-fiber mast and the independent, deck-mounted, patented, Hoyt free-standing self-vanging boom, known as the PHFSSVB.\nThe beauty of this rig-and I do own a boat with this rig-is that you can roll the mainsail up around the mast. This allows you to reef effortlessly to any increment of mainsail area and it also allows you to get rid of the main quickly when you get to the dock. You put this boat to bed in 30 seconds. You get under way in 30 seconds. This is good. It allows for those impulse sails when half an hour of presail preparation might be enough to convince you to stay home. Consider that this squatty little boat has an SA/D of 34.\nThis hull looks remarkably like that of any other catboat. Even some of the old cats had hollowed entries. The Hoyt catboat pushes this hollow farther and reduces volume forward. I suppose the turn of the bilge aft might be tighter than the older models, but I don't have hull lines so that's just a guess. Traditional catboats had big, triangular, flat-plate centerboards. These worked\u00d1somewhat. Garry's board is a higher-aspect-ratio board that is shown with two different shapes depending upon the drawing. Note how far aft the board is. This will help with weather helm.\nThe Express Cat's rudder is quite unusual. Catboats traditionally had big, barn-door rudders, long in chord and short in span. Moving the center of pressure of the rudder exacerbated the cat's proclivity for weather helm. Heel an old catboat over and this rudder blade acted like a speed-brake drag device. Excessive chord length was intended to make up for lack of span, as shoal draft was a requisite of these boats. The basic catboat rudder has become a classic-looking shape and Garry retained that while using an innovative pivoting blade that drops out of the big rudder cheeks. This gives the cat a modern, high-aspect-ratio rudder blade. The rudder blade swings up when you bump the bottom.\nAn important part of sailing for me is independence. I see this catboat as a way for the less-than-athletic sailor to get away by himself and to sail safe and dry in any weather. I hate outboards, so I'd give it a try without auxiliary power for a while. I'd just fit a tiller-operated autopilot, pack a generous lunch, take a few issues of The Audiophile Voice and enjoy a day of relaxing sailing and reading. If this sounds good, don't overlook Garry Hoyt's new catboat. Sailboats don't have to be complicated to be fun.\nLOA 19'2\"; LWL 17'6\"; Beam 8'6\"; Draft board-up 14\", board down 4'; Displ. 1,450 lb.; Sail area 272 sq. ft.; SA/D 34; D/L 120; L/B 2.25\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Perry on Design\nAlerion Express 28\nBavaria C46\nHanse 360\nSwan 51\nSun Odyssey 350\nNautitech Open 48\nBali 5.8\nDufour 44\nOutbound 5360\nCayman 28\nAlso from Robert H.

I've used a Martec folding prop on my boat since the early 1990s with no problems. The only \"trouble\" you can have with a folding prop is if fails to open, and there are a limited number of reasons why this can happen. One is stiffness or corrosion in the pivot, for which disassembly and cleaning is the answer. The other is wear-folding props have moving parts so wear is an issue.\nIn the case of the Martec, when you pinch the blades closed they should not touch. There should be a minimum gap of quarter inch between them. If the blades touch, or worse, you can wiggle the closed blades back and forth, the stops are worn and the prop needs to be reconditioned.\nFor a nominal fee Martec will weld new stops on the blades and the prop should work like new. This is a lot better than paying hundreds of dollars for a whole new prop.\nWayne Simpson\nBrick Township, New Jersey\nDear Wayne,\nThanks for the tip, I did not realize that Martec (\nwww.martec-props.com\n, 928-778-2035) offered this service. I spoke to them and got clarification on the service and the costs.\nThe representative from Martec tells me they expect a prop to last between five and 10 years before needing service, depending on use and conditions. There are essentially two ways the props wear-the open and close stops as you described and the pivot pins themselves get loose and out-of-round.\nIf the stops wear, the prop will not reliably open. You can tell this wear is happening as you describe, the blades should stay a quarter-inch apart when closed. If the pins wear, the prop will likely develop a vibration. You can detect this wear by excess wiggle in the prop blades.\nMartec's rebuild service replaces the pivot pins with an oversized pin, rewelds the stops as needed, balances the prop, and replaces the cotter pins.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Boat Doctor\nHow do I connect solar panels?\nShould I ditch the hanks for a roller furler?\nCan I drop in lithium batteries?\nWhy won\u2019t my holding tank pump out?\nWhich way is better: Erie Canal or  the St. Lawrence?\nHow do I prepare for a new boat delivery?\nHow do I keep my A-sail under control?\nHow do I replace leaking hatches?\nHow do I stop my mast from leaking?\nHow should I rig a preventer?\nAlso from Bob Pingel\nDiesel engine care\nHow do I connect solar panels?\nOptimizing shore power\nShould I ditch the hanks for a roller furler?\nCan I drop in lithium batteries?\nWhy won\u2019t my holding tank pump out?\nWhich way is better: Erie Canal or  the St. Lawrence?\nHow do I prepare for a new boat delivery?\nHow do I keep my A-sail under control?\nThe knots you need to know\nSubscribe\nFollow Us\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to get the latest from SAILING Magazine delivered via email.\nEmail Address\n*\nEmail Format\nhtml\ntext\n*\nindicates required\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nPowered by\nWEHAA.COM\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Sailing Magazine, All rights reserved.\nClose\nClose\nClose",

Once you leave the United States, or navigate into blue water, your domestic health insurance coverage may have large gaps in coverage. At Risk Strategies, we understand the coverage you need \u2010 in and outside of the US \u2010 and have the solutions to protect you around the globe. The programs are affordable and can be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act.\nMedical insurance solutions for\nCommercial fishermen\nPaid crew & captains\nInternational cruisers\nProfessional sailors\nExpatriates\nUS Sailing members (learn more)\nCoverage highlights include\nWorldwide coverage\nMedical evacuation\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment\nPrescription Coverage\nOptions with and without US coverage\nEligibility requirements include\nExtended time spent navigating in blue water\nTravel outside the US for extended periods of time\nWorking in and out of the US through the year\nQuestions and more information\nContact\nCrewMedicalgowrie@risk-strategies.com\nWhat makes this program so special for mariners?\nThis specialized health insurance program for US Sailing members provides worldwide coverage and includes AD&D (accident death and dismemberment), medical evacuation and bedside visitation coverages as well as all other health insurance coverage expected in the U.S. In addition, the program includes mPassport, a portable medical care access tool for use worldwide. The program is underwritten by Geo Blue\nWho manages this crew medical health insurance program?\nThe program is managed by Gowrie Group. Rick Bagnall is the program manager; you can reach him at\nrbagnall@risk-strategies.com\nor 860.399.3634.\nWho is eligible?\nThere are six general categories of sailors that may qualify for US Sailing\u2019s group crew medical insurance program. (Please note: Current US Sailing membership is required.)\nCertified US Sailing instructors\nCollegiate sailing athletes\nMembers of US Olympic Sailing Team\nProfessional crew/captains\nPaid race yachts crew\nInternational cruisers\nWhat if I am a US Sailing member, but I do not fit neatly into one of these categories?\nPlease contact Rick Bagnall at\nrbagnall@risk-strategies.com\nor 860.399.3634 to discuss\nDoes this policy offer coverage inside the United States, for the time periods when I am not abroad or offshore?\nYes, the policy offers coverage in the United States, using the Anthem network.\nWhen can I enroll?\nThis is an annual insurance policy. US Sailing members can enroll in this program during Open Enrollment which runs from July 1st to August 31st. The policy period starts September 1st.\nAfter Open Enrollment, enrollment is closed unless the US Sailing member has a qualifying event.\nCan I enroll online?\nOnline enrollment is available only during the Open Enrollment period which runs from July 1st to August 31st. To enroll at other times, contact Rick Bagnall at\nrbagnall@risk-strategies.com\nor 860.399.3634. Please note that premiums are payable by credit card only.\nWhy are the premiums so low in the US Sailing Group crew medical program?\nSeveral factors contribute to the low premiums in this program.\nMany people covered in the program spend time outside of the United States for much of the year, and health insurance coverage is a lot less expensive overseas.\nMany in the program have multiple sources of coverage (eg, paid crew typically have P&I from the vessel), thus the full exposure to risk is lower.\nWithin US Sailing\u2019s membership base, the majority that qualifies for this coverage tend to be younger.\nWhat is a qualifying event?\nBenefit plans can be affected by life event changes, some of which qualify as an official change in status by the IRS. Generally, when you enroll in benefits as a new employee, you cannot make any changes until the next Open Enrollment period. However, if you experience a qualified change in status you can make mid-year changes. A qualifying event, also called a life event change, is a personal change in status which may allow you to change your benefit elections. Examples of some qualifying events include, but are not limited to, the following:\nChange in legal marital status \u2013 marriage, divorce, legal separation, annulment, death of a spouse.\nChange in number of dependents \u2013 birth, death, adoption, placement for adoption, award of legal guardianship.\nChange in employment status of the employee\u2019s spouse or employee\u2019s dependent \u2013 switching from part-time to full-time employment status or from full-time to part-time, termination or commencement of employment, a strike or lockout, commencement of or return from an unpaid leave of absence which results in employee/dependent becoming ineligible for coverage.\nDependent satisfies or ceases to satisfy eligibility requirement \u2013 marriage of a dependent or change in student status.\nHow do I enroll if I have a qualifying event?\nIt is important to remember that if you experience a qualifying event, you will need to request a change to your benefits within 30 calendar days of the event and provide required documentation. If you do not request the change within 30 calendar days, the next opportunity you will have to make changes to your benefits will be during the next Open Enrollment period.\nWhat if my US physician or hospital is not listed in Geo Blue\u2019s online provider network?\nThe next step would be to call your Physician or Hospital directly and see if they are in the Anthem network. If they are in the Anthem network they should accept Geo Blue.\nCan this insurance be offered as a group benefit to a team or group of sailors?\nYes. We can set up a group contract and supply a statement directly to your business. This allows employees the extra benefit of paying their premium through payroll deduction and receiving their benefits as a pre-tax benefit. In order to set up a group contract, please contact Rick Bagnall at\nrbagnall@risk-strategies.com\nor 860.399.3634\nWho is the insurance carrier for this program?\nGeo Blue is the carrier for the US Sailing group crew medical program.

Geo Blue annually provides health insurance products or services to more than 650,000 individuals who travel, study or live outside of their home country.

In the United States, Geo Blue uses the Anthem physician and hospital network.\nWhat is Risk Strategies/Gowrie Group's role in the US Sailing health insurance plan?\nRisk Strategies/Gowrie Group is US Sailing\u2019s insurance partner and manages this health insurance program.

Last year I overheated one of them and blew a head gasket. Overheating had been a problem for some time prior, incidentally. Anyway, I determined shortly thereafter that the gasket had blown into the cylinder although no cooling fluid had escaped. So I hired a diesel shop to\nOnan genset spewing black smoke\nDecember 1, 2010\nQuestion: I have a 4-kW Marine Onan genset with 600 hours on it. If I let it run for a lengthy period it produces so much black smoke that a residue discolors the hull around the exhaust port. A year ago, I cleaned the heat exchanger and installed a new raw-water pump. There are no overheating issues. Do I have an injector or rack problem?\u2014Charlie Carpenter, Morristown, New\nNoisy Engines\nNovember 1, 2010\nQuestion: I have a pair of Detroit Diesel 6-71 TIBs in my 1990 Ocean 48 Super Sport. I love both the boat and the motors, but the Detroits have always been loud at the exhaust end of things. As I grow older, this noise is starting to bother me, particularly at times when I have to shout to be heard on the flying bridge at cruise speed.

Since Costco hit town, we\u2019ve all been able to buy Chevron 15W-40 Delo 400 heavy-duty motor oil at ridiculously low prices. But what about the older engines we\u2019ve been using straight 40W Delo 400 and other single-viscosity products in for years? Can we\nUsing synthetic oils in older engines\nQuestion: I own a 1996 43-foot Hatteras with twin six-cylinder Detroit Diesel engines. I change the oil approximately every 100 hours of operation. At this point, I have 1,200 hours on each diesel and so far have only used non-synthetic oil.

Georgie Corlett-Pitt tells their story.\nAuthor\n:\nGeorgie Corlett-Pitt\nPublished Date:\n2 December 2025\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nEllie Driver & Ollie Hill sailing in the Figaro  |  Photo credit: Vincent Olivaud\nJust a few seasons ago, Ellie Driver burst onto the offshore scene racing two-up with her dad, Jim Driver, onboard their Sun Fast 3300,\nChilli Pepper\n\u2013 a move that was, in equal measures, bold and inspiring. For sure, taking on some of the UK\u2019s top offshore events two-up and while still in her teens marked a significant step-up for Ellie \u2013 her previous sailing had begun in Optimists at Trearddur Bay SC and taken her on to compete internationally with the 420 British Team. But when Covid forcibly halted that campaign, about the only way to keep racing was double-handed offshore, and while sailing with her dad may have seemed a little unusual, Ellie says, they have always got on well and \u201cit made perfect sense at the time\u201d.\nEllie Driver and Jim Driver\nNow, 2025 has brought another big step for 23-year old Ellie. A new campaign in the foiling one-design Beneteau Figaro 3 has already seen her take on one of the toughest solo offshore races,\nLa Solitaire du Figaro Paprec\n. Completing it was, she says, \u201ca dream come true\u201d, and a major tick towards her ultimate goal of the 2032 Vend\u00e9e Globe.\nWhen we speak, Ellie has just returned from competing in the Rolex Middle Sea Race \u2013 a 600nm sprint from Malta around Sicily \u2013 on board Gordon Ketelbey\u2019s fully-crewed TP52\nZen\n. While Ellie recounts the race\u2019s most memorable moments \u2013 from the dramatic start line within Valletta\u2019s Grand Harbour, to sailing past Stromboli as it spewed clouds of ash \u2013 the sailing itself she says made a complete contrast to the short-handed racing she is accustomed to, with \u201cplenty of corners and opportunities to learn, as well as a lot less personal space and a lot more sleep\u201d.\nShort-Handed Sailing\nMore used to handling the boat entirely by herself and napping for mere minutes at a time, this season Ellie has clocked up some 7,300nm of short-handed sailing, including her first transat.\nEllie on her first  single-handed race,  the brutal La Solitaire  |  Photo credit: T Campion\nUndoubtedly, short-handed sailing is where her passion lies. She attributes much of that to her dad, himself an accomplished offshore racer, who spent many years racing for the Army sailing team, and who Ellie describes as having \u201cendless energy and drive\u201d. She recalls childhood days sailing a Mirror with her dad, before progressing to squads. So when Jim suggested they give double-handed keelboat racing a try, Ellie jumped at the idea, though, she says, not without a little trepidation at racing bigger boats.\nThe twist came in the timing \u2013 and in Ellie\u2019s eagerness to make the most of any opportunity.\nIn 2020 Ellie took up a place at Southampton University studying Maritime Engineering. Instead of languishing in her room during the pandemic lockdowns, she threw herself into RORC\u2019s race scene \u2013 skeletal that year through necessity and comprising mostly short-handed events \u2013 and discovered a welcoming community embracing the burgeoning double-handed scene. At the time, the discipline was also under consideration for the\nOlympics\n.\nTaking part in their first offshore double-handed race later that year, Ellie and her dad were pleased to find themselves ahead of Shirley Robertson and Jeremy Waitt on JPK1010\nJangada\n. That was until a radio call from Shirley informed them they\u2019d missed a mark and needed to double-back several miles to correct their mistake. It was a classic rookie error, but nonetheless Ellie appreciated the inclusive approach, saying: \u201cIt was a good environment to be in as it let you push yourself harder.\u201d\nA Tough Offshore Test\nPerhaps the ultimate test for Ellie and Jim came in taking on RORC\u2019s Sevenstar Round Britain and Ireland Race \u2013 an arduous 1,800nm circumnavigation that took them exactly two full weeks to complete. This time, they finished just ahead of Shirley who was sailing two-up with Dee Caffari. Impressively, Ellie became the youngest skipper to complete the race, and one of only five female sailors to ever do so double-handed. It was a real testament to her determination in overcoming any doubts that the wider sailing community may have cast over her age, gender or ability, and an achievement that earned her Sailor of the Year at STY&Y\u2019s British Yachting Awards later that year.\nIt was about that time that Ellie had applied for\nThe Magenta Project\u2019s mentoring scheme\n. She explains how a conversation with her mentor, Annie O\u2019Sullivan, a skipper with The Maiden Factor, had encouraged her to vocalise her Vend\u00e9e Globe ambitions for the first time, and crucially, Annie\u2019s positive response had given her the confidence to pursue it.\nIt made Ellie\u2019s foray into the Figaro class the following year all the more important, and she was delighted to win at the EUROSAF Double-Handed Female European Offshore Championships with Catherine Hunt, and place second in the Mixed Double-Handed Worlds with George Kennedy. She also clocked up another Fastnet Race with her dad on\nChilli Pepper\n, this time finishing 10th double-hander and second female skipper and second youth skipper overall.\nBy now, Ellie and Jim had sailed every event they could together, and the time came to graduate from their dad-daughter duo. She smiles as she acknowledges her own highly competitive nature, saying: \u201cWe learned a huge amount together and had a lot of fun, but felt like it was naturally time to move on.\u201d\nThere was just one thing stopping her from her next step: \u201cI had promised my parents I would graduate uni before becoming a pro sailor, so I decided I should probably do my exams rather than sail across the Atlantic!\u201d\nWhile Ellie paused her sailing to complete her Masters degree, in the meantime, dad Jim had been turning his attention to developing the RORC Griffin programme, encouraging young sailors into offshore racing and creating opportunities to hone skills and gain experience that will ultimately bolster the UK yacht racing scene. With hundreds of young people already benefitting over the first few years of the scheme, Ellie is full of praise for her dad\u2019s involvement and the impact that it is having.\nAmbitions Aligned: Ellie Driver & Ollie Hill\nFor Ellie, the moment she graduated she set her sights on her next challenge \u2013 the Transat Paprec; acquiring her own Figaro \u2013 named for her inspirational partnership with the support charity, Women\u2019s Engineering Society \u2013 and teaming up with co-skipper, Ollie Hill for this unique double-handed/mixed-gender event.\nOllie and Ellie  |  Photo credit: Figaro\nOllie joins our chat also freshly returned from completing the Middle Sea Race on Simon Toms\u2019 SunFast 3300,\nZephyr\n\u2013 notably having won IRC6 and 10th overall on IRC. The affable 25-year old explains that, after graduating in Yacht Design from Southampton Solent, he was inspired to step into the Figaro fleet by Nigel King, Volvo Ocean Race sailor and coach to Shirley and Dee\u2019s two-handed campaign, with whom he had worked on several pro sailing campaigns.\nWhile Ollie\u2019s ambitions stop short of his own Vend\u00e9e Globe campaign, his focus is firmly on winning La Solitaire du Figaro, a goal that stands as an achievement in its own right. The class, he says, \u201coffers very pure racing and creates incredibly talented sailors in a remarkably short time\u201d, noting that not only does the fleet feed many top-level sailors into Class40 and IMOCA campaigns, but it retains a very high calibre of sailors, and as such, the class is notoriously difficult to dominate. He points to Alexis Loison\u2019s win of this year\u2019s La Solitaire on the 19th attempt, showing an inspiring combination of talent and tenacity. Ollie\u2019s own extensive experience shows similar qualities: as a 17-year old, he set a world record for sailing around the Isle of Wight in 11.5 hours \u2013 in an Optimist! Later, after competing at international level with the British squads, he went on to race in IRC and SB20s in the Middle East, then taking on the\nARC\n, and racing on the Caribbean circuit before a return to the UK for university, which launched him into the RORC racing scene at the front of Cape 31 and IRC fleets. Making his mark in short-handed sailing, he won the opening leg of the IRC Double-Handed Euros in 2024 with Josh Dawson.\nAfter realising their ambitions were closely aligned, in early 2025, Ellie and Ollie relocated to\nBrittany\n, the epicentre of offshore racing. A brave decision for the young couple but one that gained them an invitation to join the Lorient Grand Large academy. Offering an intense programme for solo sailors focussing on nav, weather routing and endurance sailing skills, the academy provides a level of training that\u2019s been noticeably absent in the UK since the demise of the Artemis Offshore Academy, nearly a decade ago. While schemes like the Griffin Project are now working to redress that skills gap on home waters, the move to France meant Ollie and Ellie could fast-track their learning.\nEllie Driver & Ollie Hill\nThere, they have found appeal in the focused and professional approach to campaigning, and were delighted by the ready acceptance they\u2019ve been offered as serious contenders \u2013 despite the language barrier! \u2013 as Ollie describes: \u201cEveryone is there to help each other. There\u2019s a strong sense of camaraderie because everyone knows how tough this kind of sailing is.\u201d\nEllie says the training has sharpened her self-taught approach and pushed her sailing to a higher standard.\nTaking on the Figaro: A Learning Experience\nThe first chance for the duo to test their newly acquired Figaro skills came in April last year year, with the double-handed Transat Paprec \u2013 a 3,890nm race which took them 19 days, racing from Concarneau in Brittany to St Barths in the Caribbean, via a mark in the Canaries.\nTheir sense of achievement in completing such a marathon was overwhelming. Ellie describes it as an \u201cadventure\u201d in which they faced everything, from autopilot failure to winds of 60kts \u2013 but says that above all it was \u201ca great eye-opener as to areas we could improve\u201d.\nRelief at the finish of the 3890nm Transat  |  Photo credit: Vincent Olivaud\nImmediately after returning to Europe, they began preparing for the 1,850nm single-handed multi-stage race, La Solitaire du Figaro Paprec, from Rouen on the northern French coast, to Vigo, Spain and back to Normandy. Ollie \u2013 having only initially set out to do the double-handed Transat \u2013 decided to continue training, digging into savings to charter his own Figaro,\nConnected by Water\n.\nStart day arrived, and having done only one solo race previously\u2013 over just two days and in light airs \u2013 Ellie and Ollie set off from Rouen, each determined to give La Solitaire their best shot; the two Brits among only five non-French sailors in the 35-strong fleet.\nWith three, five-day legs and as little as 24 hours onshore in between, both agree the experience was compelling yet exhausting: from dodging the tail end of an Atlantic storm and criss-crossing the Channel\u2019s busy shipping lanes multiple times, to battling the wilds of Biscay then floundering in zero wind.\n\u201cWith a fleet of 35 identical boats racing in such close quarters, Figaro racing is almost like dinghy racing \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to relax,\u201d explains Ollie, who says by leg three they were both feeling the effects of cumulative sleep deprivation. Although they had support from a pr\u00e9parateur on shore, as well as parents and friends handling logistics, the very short stopovers made for little respite. \u201cYou start to question your decisions,\u201d says Ollie. \u201cThat was, mentally and physically, the most taxing leg. But it\u2019s incredible what your body can do without sleep for so many days in horrendous circumstances, even if, at the time, you are running on adrenaline \u2013 and the stress of such a compressed fleet. However, by the end everyone completely crashed!\u201d\nPlacing 19th overall and 5th Rookie Ollie was also the first non-French finisher and was duly awarded the coveted Vivi Trophy. It was an outstanding result, particularly given the short preparation period, but Ollie is quick to emphasise that it illustrates how the Figaro class, while open to newcomers, demands high standards of professionalism.\nIn at the Deep End\nFor Ellie, embarking on her first full-on solo race brought a sense of \u201cin at the deep end\u201d.\n\u201cIt was great fun, but also a huge mental and physical challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cPretty quickly, I realised the enormity of what I had taken on. The biggest challenge came in the last-minute change of course on the first leg due to the weather, which threw up a lot of unknowns. But once I had completed leg one, it gave me confidence to go on and complete the next two. The race was brutal, and looking back, I\u2019m incredibly proud of what I\u2019ve achieved.\u201d\nEllie Driver and Ollie Hill - 2025 has been an incredible  season for these two  ambitious sailors  |  Photo credit: Vincent Olivaud\nWhen I ask if they\u2019d take on La Solitaire again, it\u2019s a resounding \u201cyes\u201d from both.\nWhile Ollie sums it up as a \u201chidden gem of a race \u2013 relentless, gruesome, but one that brings out brilliant sailors\u201d, Ellie explains that their search for partners to enable them to continue their campaigns is already well underway. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing battle,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you spend your time trying to get more partners, or do you go out training and improve your sailing? Realistically, both are as important as each other.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard not to sense a little frustration, naturally, but nonetheless, there\u2019s excitement there too, as they both acknowledge that success comes as much from putting in the hard yards on shore as it does from churning up the miles offshore. And if the competitive yet grounded determination they both have shown so far are anything to go by, then there\u2019s no doubt these two will be ones to back when it comes to Britain\u2019s future success in offshore racing.\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Sailing News\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nRaising Children on a Boat: How a Life Under Sail Shapes Our Kids\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Credit: iStock\nExploring Mediterranean chartering? Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily are three of the most captivating islands in the Mediterranean, each offering distinct landscapes, rich cultures, and excellent cruising opportunities for a charter holiday writes Sue Pelling.\nCorsica is known for its dramatic mountainous terrain and rugged coastline, offering a blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage. Its proximity to Sardinia (just 9nm apart) makes it an ideal starting point for a cruising adventure in the western Mediterranean. Corsica is a blend of French and Italian influences, with charming coastal villages, crystal-clear waters, and stunning beaches. The island\u2019s interior is a haven for hikers and nature lovers, with deep gorges, lush forests, and towering peaks like Monte Cinto.\nSardinia, the second-largest island in the Mediterranean, is famous for its beautiful beaches, ancient ruins, and wild, rugged landscapes. The island has a rich history dating back to the Phoenicians, Romans, and even earlier, with numerous archaeological sites scattered throughout. Sardinia is also renowned for its excellent sailing conditions, offering sheltered bays, dramatic cliffs, and idyllic islands like La Maddalena Archipelago. With Corsica so close, Sardinia also benefits from a similar Mediterranean charm but with a distinct Italian flavour.\nOld Sardinian Port with ships at Mediterranean Sea and city of Cagliari, South Sardinia Island in Italy in summer. Cityscape with marina and Yachts and boats in town\nSicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, located just off the southern tip of Italy, takes in three sea areas (Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian, and Ionian). It is therefore a land of ancient history, dramatic landscapes, and a vibrant mix of cultures. Its location however, means the northwest winds can be strong sometimes reaching 25+kts, so it\u2019s a great place if you want to expand your sailing skill. An exciting aspect of cruising in this region is the visibility of active volcanoes like Mount Etna and Stromboli. Watching the eruptions from the deck of your yacht, especially at night, can be a mesmerizing experience. Stromboli, in particular, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, providing a dynamic and ever-changing landscape if you want to explore the Aeolian Islands.\nThe relatively short distances between these islands \u2013 especially Corsica and Sardinia \u2013 make for easy and scenic cruising. Although the waters around these islands are typically calm and clear, and ideal for yacht charters, there are some areas in places like the Strait of Bonifacio between north Sardinia and Corsica, the Aeolian Islands, and in the Strait of Messina between Sicily and the mainland that are known for big winds, so always check with your charter agent who should be able to offer more detailed advice on conditions.\nAerial view showcasing its historic architecture, stunning coastline, and Mediterranean charm of Cefalu, Sicily.\nThere are numerous yacht charter companies and agents covering this particular area, with companies like\nDream Yacht Worldwide\n,\nNautilus Yachting\n,\nPlain Sailing\n, and\nSeafarer Sailing\noffering charters in all three. If you are interested in a flotilla holiday in this area, Tubber is well worth investigating because this company has a selection of package routes in all areas. On the Sardinia flotilla you can discover the dazzling Costa Smeralda and Maddalena archipelago starting from the base in Cannigione, Sardinia, all the way to Corsica. The company\u2019s week long flotilla in Sicily gives you the opportunity to explore Portorosa and the surrounding area, and sailing from one volcanic island to another in company.\nSailing Holidays offers a two-week charter holiday sailing around Sardinia and Corsica starting from Portiisco (Sardinia), just a short journey from Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport. As with all its charters, Sailing Holiday offers a comprehensive itinerary and useful sailing guide to ensure you get the best from your holiday.\nSunsail\noffers charter in Sicily from its Portorosa base, as well as the Aeolian Islands. This company also has a base for bareboat or skippered charter in Sardinia on a Sun Odyssey 319 from Cannigione into the Gulf of Arzachena. This cruise, with its fun-packed, yet cultural itinerary will ensure you see the best of what Sardinia and its glamorous coastline has to offer including recommended lunch stops at places like Cala Corlotto to the west of La Maddalena where you can anchor, sunbathe and swim in the most beautiful crystal clear water.\nGirolata Bay in Corsica, Corse-du-Sud, France. Girolata is located in the Scandola Nature Reserve. It can not be reached by car, only by walking or by boat.\nIf you are looking for a by-the-cabin charter, which is an ideal way to holiday if you are travelling solo, or are totally new to sailing/want to gain experience under the supervision of experienced crew members, then Sailsquare could be a good choice. This company has a huge range of options on a selection of different monohulls and multihulls, and what\u2019s included in the price is clearly explained on its website.\nFor bareboat charter in particular, there are plenty of independent yacht charter agents who cover the area including samboat, the globesailor and\nAnchor.yt\n. Most of the websites are extremely informative and some even offer an option to sign up a skipper. The globesailor is a good example of yacht charter agent that also offers a by-the-cabin charter package.\nAs with all sailing holidays where \u2018complete packages\u2019 are advertised, ensure you check what\u2019s actually included because most companies don\u2019t, for example, include flights or transfers. And when you are in a shared yacht situation such as by-the-cabin, there will more than likely be extra funds required (often fixed rate) to cover food and drink onboard, fuel, mooring fees and other costs.\nMore on Chartering\nFive Chartering Mistakes to Avoid: Become a Yacht Charter Expert\nSustainable Yacht Charters: Finding Responsible Companies\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Destinations\nIonian Sailing in Autumn: Guide to Exploring Greek Islands in the Off-Season\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nPremier Falmouth Marina: Guide and Cruising Grounds\nGuide to Cruising Ithaca: Greek Charter Destinations\nChartering in Spain: Guide to Spanish Coast & Balearic Island\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Jorden Lacey (JT), a Marlow Ropes Ambassador and member of the crew onboard Team Warrant, has been documenting the highs and lows of life at sea, as he takes on this 40,000 nautical mile, six-ocean circumnavigation.\nAuthor\n:\nMilly Karsten\nPublished Date:\n6 October 2025\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nWarrent - Clipper Race 2025  |  Photo credit: Marlow Ropes\nAfter stepping away from over 15 years in finance, and drawing on previous sailing experience, JT has partnered up with the official running rigging supplier,\nMarlow Ropes\n, taking on the role of supporting the Bosun with rigging and repairs on board their Clipper boat. Here\u2019s JT\u2019s updates from the last month or so at sea.\nJT on Warrant  |  Photo credit: Jorden Lacey\nRace 1, Leg 1\nOn 31st August 2025, the\nClipper fleet departed Portsmouth\n, toward Puerto Sherry, Spain. From the outset, the crew faced headwinds and challenging seas in the Bay of Biscay, pushing them to stay vigilant and adapt their tactics.\nJT told Marlow - \u201cThe Battle over Biscay in this Race Edition was undeniably tough for everyone. In that period we encountered not one, but three depressions coming through the North Atlantic, and what could have been a shorter and more comfortable downwind trip became a much more challenging, and tactical, upwind beat for most of the time.\u201d\nArriving in Puerto Sherry, the team took 4 days to make repairs, deep clean and restock, ready for the next stage.\nRace 2, Leg 1\nTaking the Clipper fleet 5,300 NM across the Atlantic to Uruguay, Race 2 marked the first true ocean crossing.\nIn the first couple of days, JT told Marlow, \u201ca few too many heavy collapses and fill ins will flog the kite. Eventually something will give and it\u2019s unlikely to be the sheets from Marlow which have individual breaking strength of up to 10 tons\u201d\n\u201cInevitably, an over-zealous push for speed saw our Code 1 blow, with a sizeable rip. It has been recovered and we will work on a repair when we enter our Doldrums corridor.\u201d\nWarrant - Clipper Race  |  Photo credit: Jorden Lacey\nOn a particularly strenuous night, where physical and mental energy was sapping quickly, the team encountered another challenge - a shoal of flying fish. With over 20 ending up on board and one down below, the crew were spun into a frantic race to remove them.\nAfter a string of bad lunch on day 2, JT told Marlow, they went through \u201ca Code 3 drop and lace, a Yankee 1 hoist, a Code 2 hoist, a Yankee 1 drop, a blown Code 2 donut tack strop (not the dyneema, but the whipping), a Code 2 drop and lace, a Code 2 re-hoist \u2026 all within 2 hours \u2026 and finally topped off with a Code 2 wrap and drop with an untwisting and lacing exercise on deck as the sun went down!\u201d\nMaking ground towards the islands of Cape Verde, the crew began to struggle with the sun on deck and conditions down below, bringing on sleep deprivation.\nAs they headed towards the Doldrums, weighing up when to utilise their motor (60 hours of which is allowed in the race instructions to minimise risk of being stranded and impacting the race schedules downstream), the team held off for as long as possible, using the remaining wind to the final moment.\n\u201cThe Doldrums hasn\u2019t really been what we expected\u201d, JT told Marlow. Though uncomfortably hot with periods of calm, the team found a fair amount of wind, giving them time to make repairs, and clean both the boat and themselves, while also pushing on.\nAs we await JT\u2019s next update, on the race tracker we can see that Team Warrant have now crossed the Equator and have reached the coast of Brazil.\nStay tuned for more...!\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Races & Regattas\nDylan Fletcher\u2019s Inside Scoop on SailGP: Emirates GBR Making History\nAllspars Final Fling 2025: Royal Western Yacht Club\u2019s End of Season Sailing Shakedown\nWill the America\u2019s Cup Survive?\nOffshore Rising Stars Ellie Driver & Ollie Hill: Young Short-Hand Ambition and Success\nThe Dramatic Transat Caf\u00e9 L\u2019Or: Capsizes and Winners 2025\nBritish Team Win SailGP 2025: Emirates GBR Take Gold in Abu Dhabi\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Sam Jefferson caught up with Sunsail\u2019s Clive Norton to find out the company\u2019s secrets of success\n.\nLast year, Sunsail celebrated an incredible milestone \u2013 its 50th anniversary. A half-century of helping adventure-lovers explore the world from the deck of an award-winning yacht is no mean feat. Such an achievement can only be accredited to the consistent vision that has guided the company over the decades, with each generation of leadership united by a clear goal \u2013 to deliver unforgettable sailing experiences for the sailing community and beyond. To mark the occasion, we caught up with Clive Norton, VP of Revenue Management and Fleet Planning at Sunsail, to reflect on the company\u2019s roots, discussing the journey from launching a small fleet in the Saronic Gulf to becoming a world leading sailing holiday company. In this exclusive interview, we delve into Sunsail\u2019s origins, its milestones and where it is heading next.\nSunsail Vounaki Greece May 2010\nTell us about the history of Sunsail. How did it all begin?\n\u201cSunsail was founded in 1974 and began with the simple ambition to make sailing fun, accessible, and social for everyone. Our very first base was in Aegina, in the stunning Saronic Gulf of Greece, which we still sail from today. We started with just seven 25ft Snapdragon monohulls in the first flotilla. They were sturdy yachts known for their twin bilge keels, shallow draft and spacious interiors \u2013 perfect for exploring coastal waters, with ample space in the galley to cater for a family while offering relative comfort. It was a modest start, but one rooted in a deep passion for the sea.\n\u201cThe team back then was small but mighty. Skipper Janet Green led the first voyages with her Australian hostie, Megan, and English engineer David Archer. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know much about their history before Sunsail, but we do know that Janet\u2019s role was particularly groundbreaking for the time. In 1974, it was quite rare \u2013 and often challenging \u2013 for a woman to hold a lead skipper position in the sailing world, which was then overwhelmingly male-dominated. Janet\u2019s leadership not only showcased her exceptional skills and determination but also set an early example of inclusivity and progressiveness that Sunsail continues to embody today.\n\u201cThis spirit of representation and breaking boundaries set by Janet and the team has continued to shape decision-making within the business. It\u2019s no coincidence that Dee Caffari is one of Sunsail\u2019s contemporary ambassadors. Dee made history as the first woman to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in both directions, and she remains one of the most respected figures in the sport. Her achievements resonate deeply with the values set by the founding team.\n\u201cNeedless to say, the first ever flotilla trip was a great success, reaching beyond the expectations of the team, and went on to create the first market for holiday flotillas.\u201d\nHow has Sunsail evolved over the years?\n\u201cOver the last five decades, we\u2019ve come a long way. From those first flotilla holidays in Greece, we expanded across the Mediterranean, then into the Caribbean, and now offer bareboat charters in over 20 of the world\u2019s most spectacular sailing destinations. Our flotilla sailing holidays now run in three countries, and our fleet has grown from seven Snapdragons to over 340 yachts.\n\u201cThroughout our journey, we\u2019ve worked closely with iconic yacht manufacturers like Beneteau, Jeanneau, and Robertson & Caine to ensure our boats balance performance, comfort and sociability for our guests. Since the first flotilla in 1974 we have steadily invested in the fleet. By the late 1980s we had already added 120 new yachts to the Mediterranean. In 1993, we were operating 390 yachts across the Mediterranean and 100 in the Caribbean. In 2002, we placed a landmark \u00a313 million order for 180 new yachts from Jeanneau, Beneteau, Fountaine Pajot, and Lagoon, further strengthening our global offering.\n\u201cFleet renewal and expansion continued into the 2010s, with major additions from Robertson & Caine\u2019s catamaran range and upgrades to our monohull fleet to match evolving guest expectations. In 2016, we introduced the Sunsail 454 \u2013 a custom-built catamaran designed specifically for the charter market. In 2020, we launched the Sunsail 41.0, a sleek, modern yacht created in collaboration with Jeanneau. Most recently, in 2023 and 2024, we continued our fleet growth through a partnership with Dufour, investing in models such as the Sunsail 37.3 and Sunsail 41.3., reflecting our growing focus on sustainability and innovation. Each phase of fleet growth has furthered our commitment to staying ahead of industry trends and delivering exceptional sailing experiences for every type of sailor.\n\u201cAs we have grown the fleet, we have also deepened our offering to our community, which has seen our team pioneering experiences that accompany sailors through their entire journey. In 1986, we launched our first Beach Club to offer beginner-friendly holiday packages combining land and water-based activities. This marked the beginning of a series of Beach Clubs that followed across the Mediterranean and beyond. This period of time marked the opening of a new space in the market, where sailing enthusiasts could not only enjoy a holiday, but also earn their first sailing qualifications.\n\u201cBy the mid-2010s our strategy evolved and moved towards a direction more closely reflecting the business we operate today \u2013 focusing on accessibility through our\nRYA\n-accredited Sailing Schools. From there, guests could progress to flotillas and eventually set off on their own bareboat adventures.\u201d\nWhat do you think has been the secret behind Sunsail\u2019s success?\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s that Sunsail has always been run by sailors, for sailors. We understand what makes a sailing holiday special because we live and breathe it ourselves. Our goal has never changed \u2013 we want to make sailing fun, inclusive, and accessible to all.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re passionate \u2013 deeply passionate \u2013 about what we do, and how we do it. That enthusiasm translates into everything from how we design our itineraries to how our teams interact with guests. It\u2019s about creating unforgettable experiences and lifelong memories on the water.\u201d\nSunsail Vounaki Greece May 2010\nWhat are some of the most memorable highlights over the last 50 years?\n\u201cThere are so many. Launching our Caribbean bases was a big step, bringing the Sunsail experience to turquoise waters and island cultures. Another huge moment was expanding our fleet beyond the Mediterranean and adding yachts from world-renowned manufacturers.\n\u201cBut I think the most rewarding moments are the ones we hear from our guests \u2013 families who return year after year, couples who met on a flotilla and now bring their children back, or sailors who took their first lessons with us and are now skippering charters around the world. Those personal stories are what really define our legacy.\u201d\nWhat makes Sunsail unique today?\n\u201cToday, our guests have more choice than ever before. Looking for a self-guided adventure? Our bareboat charters offer the freedom to explore at your own pace \u2013 and in some locations, we\u2019re even introducing off-grid itineraries for a more remote experience. Prefer a little more structure and camaraderie? Our flotillas provide a sociable and supportive way to sail, with the added reassurance of a lead crew always close by. And if you\u2019re new to sailing, no problem \u2013 our RYA-accredited sailing schools are designed to help you learn while on holiday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hand-picked our destinations for their beauty and variety in sailing conditions \u2013 from the gentle breezes of the Ionian to the steady trade winds of the British Virgin Islands. It\u2019s all about catering to every level of sailor, from complete beginners to seasoned skippers.\nAt the heart of our business, we\u2019ve stayed true to our core values \u2013 particularly when it comes to customer service. From the very first call, guests are supported by expert holiday planners, who have sailed in the waters they\u2019re recommending. This is a deliberate choice \u2013 we want our guests to feel confident knowing they\u2019re speaking to someone with real, first-hand knowledge. That personalised service continues throughout the holiday experience, thanks to our base managers and local lead crews, who have the local insight and ability to make every guest feel supported and welcome.\u201d\nWhat do the next 50 years hold for Sunsail?\n\u201cThe next 50 years are all about sustainability and innovation. We\u2019re standing on the brink of real change in the yachting world \u2013 in how hulls are built, how boats are powered, and how we protect marine ecosystems. We want to lead that charge.\n\u201cThrough our charitable partners and award-winning internal sustainability initiatives, we\u2019re already laying the groundwork. We\u2019re also exploring how to work more responsibly with local communities in every destination we operate.\n\u201cFrom a design perspective, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with top manufacturers to stay at the forefront of yacht innovation. Listening to our guests is key \u2013 they help us find that sweet spot where comfort, performance and sociability meet.\u201d\nSunsail\u2019s journey from a humble flotilla in the Saronic Gulf to a global sailing holiday pioneer is more than a business success story \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration to a vision dedicated to a genuine love for life on the water.\nSpeaking with Clive, it\u2019s clear that while the fleet, destinations, and technology have evolved, Sunsail\u2019s core purpose has not wavered. As the brand looks ahead to the next 50 years, one thing is certain \u2013 the spirit that launched seven Snapdragons in 1974 still guides every voyage today.\nShow Me More:\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Charter Tips\nAdventure Sailing Holiday Guide: Where to Find Thrilling Charter Experiences\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nThe State of the Industry: Insights from VentureSail\nHow to Go Racing in the Caribbean: Chartering for All Skill Levels\nYacht Ownership Scheme Guide: Fractional & Shared Ownership\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Personally I have always thought his comedies lacked a bit of oomph but it must be admitted that he had a great knack of coming up with a pithy line. Anyway, the one that comes to mind when I think of Robertson and Caine, builder of\nLeopard Catamarans\n, is the following:\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.\nThis may seem somewhat obscure but let me elaborate. At present, Leopard is the third biggest manufacturer of multihulls in the world and the largest in the southern hemisphere. How did this happen? Well, for one, I\u2019m sure it has always built excellent boats but, up until the late \u201990s it was producing relatively modest numbers of quite sporty boats (anyone remember the Fast 42?). All well and good, but there are many excellent boatbuilders who don\u2019t go on to grow exponentially. The pivot point in Robertson and Caine\u2019s growth appeared when the manufacturer came to the attention of the Moorings charter group that asked the company to build a line of catamarans that would dovetail with the demands of their charter clients. One thing led to another and Robertson and Caine\u2019s Leopard Catamarans are now ubiquitous not just in the Moorings fleet but also Sunsail\u2019s which is part of the same group.\nNow, that is all very well but it has meant the Leopard catamarans can end up getting a bit pigeonholed as pure charter vessels, and this is far from the truth. In reality, the yard has been turning out boats that are good for both charter and private ownership. Mass production has kept costs down and the price of labour in South Africa also helps. All of which this convoluted preamble brings me to the new Leopard 46; first of a new generation of Leopards. It replaces the Leopard 45 which was launched back in 2017 and sold over 400 units. The 46 is a tad bigger and, as with all manufacturers these days, the aim seems to be to offer more space and comfort while not compromising performance. The launch of the 46 also finds the company looking to diversify and underline that it has a product that is well cut out for private ownership. That, I guess, is where I come in. so what have we here? Well, it\u2019s clearly a pure cruising catamaran \u2013 there are stub keels as opposed to daggerboards \u2013 so this is a boat built to compete with the likes of\nLagoon\n, Bali and perhaps\nFountaine Pajot\n. Weighing in at 17,000kg, this is not a particularly light boat but, as with all cruising cats these days, you can expect performance to be respectable. As with all Leopards, the design is by Simonis and Voogdt who have a lot of experience in this sector. In terms of construction, the boat is something of a break from the norm for the manufacturer. Whereas previous models used three separate moulds for the hull components then glassed them together, this new boat is built in one single mould which should aid stiffness.\nLeopard 46\nWhat is important to understand about this genre of cruising catamarans is that they are capable of quite extraordinary feats. Sailing around the world is far from mission improbable; it has been done many times. By the same token, don\u2019t expect too many thrills; your Lagoons and Leopards etc are competent performers but, ultimately, the autopilot is your friend. Use it and you can enjoy the boat\u2019s finer qualities. One of the other fascinating features of this boat was the electric motors used on the test model. These are an optional extra and are supplied by Alternative Energies, a company that is actually a subsidiary of rival boatbuilder Fountaine Pajot, which has taken the laudable step of making its units available to anyone in an effort to boost innovation and drive costs down. The test boat was equipped with two 25kw electric motors and, of course, all the extra gizmos and batteries that come with that. We\u2019ll get onto the nitty gritty of the electric motors later in the test.\nOn Deck\nYou step aboard the boat via broad aft platforms which offer excellent access. The first thing you notice is the huge bathing platform which doubles as storage for the tender. This is one of those elaborate designs that is raised and lowered electrically in order to allow it to be fully submersed for easy launch and recovery of the dinghy. They are clever but both heavy and elaborate and it\u2019s no surprise that this is an optional extra; electric davits are standard. Two steps up and you\u2019re into the cockpit that\u2019s kept completely rope free and is reasonably enclosed with a big L-shaped seating area to port which is ideal for dining in warm weather. There is plentiful seating here, with a long bench seat running latitudinally and enclosing the transom. This seat has a bolster which pivots, meaning you can look at the sea facing aft if you like \u2013 a nice touch. To starboard are the steps up to the fly bridge and there is a fridge set into this, while the barbecue is integrated into the coamings to port. It looks neat and is well hidden but is not that well sited as I\u2019d anticipate that smoke from the barbecue would tend to blow into the cockpit.\nLeopard 46\nLeopard wanted to retain defined indoor and outdoor spaces so, even though there is a large sliding patio door, there is still clear definition between the spaces. Nevertheless, in warm weather, the cockpit itself is a wonderful living space, with the solid Bimini which runs all the way aft, adding protection.\nAs mentioned, the fly bridge is accessed from the starboard side of the cockpit although there are also steps up from the starboard side deck. The fly bridge is the nerve centre of the 46 and all the sail controls are led here meaning that in theory the boat can be singlehanded with minimum amounts of stress and no need to leave your seat. Catamarans with fly bridges often face a dilemma in that you don\u2019t want to have the skipper too separated off from the lounging area, while also wanting to separate off all the sail controls and have the skipper at a height where he or she can see what\u2019s going on. In the 46, there is a decent connection between the two areas, as the steps up are quite open and offer a clear line of vision if the skipper looks down into the cockpit.\nOnce installed at the helm, the seat is very comfortable and also sociable as two can sit alongside each other without any stress. The set-up is good with all lines leading back to three powered winches all situated close to the helm. To port of the helm is a bridge deck which, once again, is all about the lounging space. This is accessed from the side decks to port and, as you can imagine, is nicely involved with the skipper\u2019s space while also remaining separate from all the ropes. It\u2019s the ideal spot for a sundowner. Aft of this the solid bimini stretches a long way back and has recesses moulded in that will accommodate solid solar panels. Right aft is the mainsheet on a traveller. The mainsail is at a good height for stowing but it is worth noting that you need to brief crew not to stand on the solar panels which, being the rigid type could get damaged if you tread heavily on them.\nStepping back down to deck level and the side decks are wide, making for a pleasant walkway to the foredeck, although this area can also be accessed via a watertight front door from the main saloon. The foredeck is semi solid with only a small trampoline area. The seating area is in a recessed well with loungers on deck in front and decent storage underneath. The charter versions do not have a bowsprit but the test boat did. All in all, there was a simply vast amount of outdoor space and a good blend of shaded and sunny areas.\nDown Below\nHead down below and you\u2019re in a big saloon with a lot of light. The windows are apparently the largest in the class and are glass instead of the plexiglass seen on the old Leopard 45. This has less issues with heat expansion than plexiglass according to Leopard. There is a U-shaped seating area to port with its own table that can be folded out to double the width. The galley is to starboard and set well forward with the double sink set against the forward bulkhead latitudinally, and the electric cooker and drawer fridge set longitudinally almost the length of the cabin, only interrupted by the descent into the forward and aft cabins. There is a chart table forward to port and this is large and comfortable with a great seat meaning that it could definitely double as a very pleasant office space.\nLeopard 46 interior\nDescend down into the starboard hull and the master cabin is set aft with a good sized king sized bed set fore and aft and a heads with separate shower stall. It\u2019s a sensible size and there\u2019s also a small vanity table and a TV making for a very practical and comfortable sleeping area. Forward of this and still to starboard is another double set latitudinally with a narrow heads/shower set right forward. It\u2019s a sensible use of space. The double bed is well raised up which can be a pain to get into in a seaway but this does give you a nice view through the port light.\nLeopard 46 interior\nThe port hull has a double aft which is a good sized bed with partial walkaround access and plentiful light. There is a decent sized ensuite forward to port. Forward of this is a corridor with a washing machine set into the storage units on the starboard side. On this boat there is a utility room which seemed a bit superfluous but good for storage \u2013 particularly as it linked to the bow storage compartment. As you can imagine, on the charter version, this can be turned back into a double berth but for bluewater cruising a utility room and all the storage it brings could be a real boon.\nElectric Motors\nIn standard configuration, the 46 is powered by twin 45hp Yanmar diesels although these can be upgraded to 57hp. However, from our point of view, the hybrid electric option on the test boat was of far greater interest. This features twin 25kW electric pods combined with a 24kW range-extending generator and two 27kWh lithium-iron phosphate battery banks. The banks are identical but separate for redundancy should one side fail. Power regeneration is accomplished via shore power, the diesel generator, 1,600 watts of solar panels on the Bimini, and hydrogeneration via the two 18in propellers spinning when under sail. Although regeneration starts at speeds as low as 5kts, you\u2019ll need to sail 8kts or more to generate 1.5-1.8kW per hour per hull.\nThe key statistic here is that the electric motors give six hours of autonomy at half speed. The solar panels and hydrogeneration are more for domestic power when you\u2019re at anchor. Realistically, you\u2019re going to need to use the generator to replenish those battery banks. That sounds a touch disheartening but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the generator is more efficient than a pure diesel motor as it will always run at maximum efficiency for the conditions and requirements of the battery. The cost of the hybrid electric version is circa 200,000 Euros which seems quite a lot but it is worth bearing in mind that you get the whole kit; generator and upgraded lithium ion batteries for this price and these items alone are costly if you take them from the options list but stick with a diesel engine.\nUnder Sail\nUnder power the boat is eerily silent when leaving the dock and it is a real pleasure not to have the rumble of the diesel engine in the background. At higher speeds the electric motors make a bit of a whining noise but obviously it\u2019s far, far less than a diesel engine and we easily did 6.5kts. In terms of handling, the powered winches made making sail on a day when there wasn\u2019t a huge amount of breeze at least to start with, an absolute breeze. The steering is cable driven as opposed to hydraulic which gave it a decent amount of feel but it was still relatively uninspiring and the autopilot is definitely your friend. As mentioned, in the early stages of this test, there was not a great deal of wind so it was a good opportunity to play with the electric motors. We experimented with firing up the generator which obviously created some noise but was still markedly quieter than a standard diesel-propelled yacht. In part this was because the generator on the 46 is in the storage area in front of the saloon meaning that you are generally well away from the motor. Going flat out with the electric motors we hit 9.2kts in relatively flat water. That\u2019s not bad going at all although obviously without the generator as backup, you\u2019re going to flatten your batteries relatively rapidly. As the test progressed, the breeze filled in, although it was never more than 10kts. Nevertheless, in these modest conditions, the boat hit 4.5kts on the wind and, easing the sheets we were doing 6.2kts which was good in the fickle conditions.\nLeopard 46\nSam\u2019s Verdict\nGiven that Leopard mass produce these boats, it simply cannot afford to turn out a dud and it has the experience and expertise to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen. The 46 is a great boat for cruising in comfort and works well both as a charter boat or as a privately owned yacht. Performance is good as opposed to exhilarating but that really isn\u2019t what these cruising catamarans are all about. The pricing is very attractive, and if you are interested in shared ownership, then the strong relationship the company has with\nSunsail\n/The Moorings makes this a really enticing option.\nblue water: 4\n/5\nPerformance: 3\n/5\ncomfort: 5\n/5\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Boat Tests\nSwan 51 Boat Test: A Top Quality Yacht That Dares You to Dream\nBeneteau First 36E Boat Test: New Planing Speedster\nSeawind 1170 Boat Test: New Cat with Completely Different Feel\nSaare 41.2 Boat Test: New Estonian Cruising Yacht\nGrand Soleil Blue Boat Test: The New Slick Performance Dayboat\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nRaising Children on a Boat: How a Life Under Sail Shapes Our Kids\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

You\u2019ll find that many Caribbean islands that run regattas are major social and cultural events, blending sport, music, food, and island spirit. This cocktail of hard core, adrenaline-driven racing, and legendary rum punch-fuelled apr\u00e8s-race parties are what Caribbean regattas are all about because above all they foster unforgettable memories and friendships that will probably last a lifetime.\nThe main Caribbean race season runs from January to late April, which not only avoids the hurricane season, but also gives overseas visitors plenty of time to make their trip south worthwhile, with many, particularly pro teams, using the Caribbean circuit as an ideal shake down to the forthcoming northern hemisphere race season.\nCaribbean race charter  |  Photo credit: Gabe Rovick\nThere is a packed calendar of regattas to choose from and, thanks to the Caribbean Sailing Association (\nCSA\n), which promotes each event with its own identity, dates rarely clash, which means you could realistically take part in the whole Caribbean race series.\nIf however, holiday time is limited, you may want to return to your favourite haunt with events like\nSt Maarten Heineken Regatta\n, the\nBVI Spring Regatta & Sailing Festival\n, or\nAntigua Sailing Week\nsome of the most popular. For something different, yet equally fun and extremely competitive, maybe consider St Thomas International Regatta or St Barths Bucket.\nGiven its popularity, there\u2019s a good choice of race yacht charter companies serving the Caribbean and covering events and feeder race/cruises such as the\nWorld Cruising Club Atlantic Rally for Cruisers\n(ARC and ARC+) an event which sets off across the Atlantic from Gran Canaria to the Caribbean mid to late November. This means there are many opportunities to sign up for a berth on either a private charter yacht, or charter yacht through companies such as LV Yachting, Go West Sailing, or Firstaway Yacht Charter.\nWhile many companies offer crewed or bareboat charter options, a growing sector is individual berth charter. Sea to Sky Sailing primarily offers individual berth race charter opportunities aboard its race optimised Salona 45,\nPanacea X\n. Katy Campbell (Sea to Sky Sailing Director and lead race skipper) commented: \u201cWe are a frequent feature of the podium across the whole Caribbean circuit, and in 2025 were awarded the Traveler\u2019s Trophy for being the top performing boat of the year. We are usually the only female-skippered boat on the circuit, often the only one flying the maple leaf, and one of the few associated with an RYA training centre.\nAntigua English Harbour, Nelson's Dockyard  |  Photo credit: Shutterstock\n\u201cFor the 2025/2026 Caribbean season, we will be racing in St Lucia\u2019s Mango Bowl, Barbados Sailing Week, Rum to Spice Offshore Race, Grenada Sailing Week, RORC Caribbean 600, St Maarten Heineken Regatta, BVI Regatta and Antigua Sailing Week. We\u2019re looking forward to another great season and look forward to having many familiar faces back on board as well as new crew joining us from all over the world.\u201d\nAnother popular company is LV Yachting which specialises in race yacht charters across the Caribbean, and is passionate about connecting teams with high-performance yachts \u2013 from Volvo Ocean 65s and ORC winners to multihulls and top-tier racer cruisers. LV\u2019s Chris Bruty commenting on what\u2019s on offer said: \u201cWe offer whole-boat and crewed charters for events including the RORC Caribbean 600, Heineken Regatta, BVI Spring Regatta, Antigua Sailing Week and more. With 15+ years\u2019 experience, we tailor every charter to the crew\u2019s needs, handling logistics like berthing, race entry, and concierge support. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned campaigner or new to Caribbean regattas, our personalised service ensures a competitive, seamless and unforgettable racing experience.\u201d\nAs well as being one of the key cruising charter companies, Sunsail also offers a range of race charter options in the Caribbean. Caroline Barbour, Sunsail\u2019s Marketing Manager UK/ZA/AU said: \u201cOur team of expert holiday planners can offer advice on chartering a bareboat or skippered yacht, suitable for seasoned crews and those new to racing. The key events for next season include the BVI Spring Regatta, Antigua Sailing Week, Grenada Sailing Week, and the St Maarten Heineken Regatta.\n\u201cCustomers benefit from the maintained charter fleet and access to Sunsail\u2019s experienced skippers. It\u2019s an excellent way to gain race entry, shore-side support, and seamless participation in top-tier Caribbean regattas. Off the water, racers enjoy legendary socials, island hospitality, and an unbeatable party atmosphere that comes with every regatta.\u201d\nSecond Star Sailing, which participates in events such as Grenada Sailing Week, RORC 600 Caribbean, St Maarten Heineken Regatta, and St Barths Bucket also specialises in women\u2019s sailing, and is particularly keen to promote its Women at the Helm in the Caribbean. Second Star Sailing\u2019s Aliya Brown commenting on this popular programme said: \u201cThrough our all-women race team programme, Women at the Helm, Second Star Sailing is happy to support women in competitive sailing. Our two-week package is meant to give female sailors more confidence and skills.\n\u201cIt includes a full week of race training skills to support passionate women in developing their skills in any role on a racing team, whether they are helm, trimmer, bow, or tactician. During the second week, we will be on the water for Antigua Sailing Week, racing with a crew that is excited to share their knowledge. Based in Antigua, we are dedicated to getting more women involved in racing by giving them access, mentoring, and world-class training in a lively regatta setting.\u201d\nFinally it\u2019s worth remembering that access to the Caribbean with direct flights from the UK to many islands makes chartering a yacht a good option particularly if leisure time is more restricted. If you are flexible with time, you may be able to find some good last-minute deals, so it\u2019s worth keeping an eye out online (see Useful contacts below).\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Charter Tips\nAdventure Sailing Holiday Guide: Where to Find Thrilling Charter Experiences\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nThe State of the Industry: Insights from VentureSail\nYacht Ownership Scheme Guide: Fractional & Shared Ownership\nWhat Is the Secret to Sunsail\u2019s Success?\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

I was on the committee that vetted applications for the\nOcean Cruising Club\u2019s Challenge Grant\nwhen Project Manaia had applied for a grant to support their environmental work in the Mediterranean. Then, my generation had no concept that there were dangers to the environment, so I am playing catch up on that score. There again, except for a short passage from Tierra-Veja in southeast Spain to Gibraltar I had never sailed in the Mediterranean \u2013 too crowded! And then I had never been back to Malta since I had been stationed there as a young officer in 45 Commando, Royal Marines in the 1950s. So, I joined Project Manaia for their end of season sea passage from Kefalonia to Malta.\nThe heat hit you as soon as you stepped off the plane. This was\nGreece\nin late summer after all. Local travel arrangements went well and I was soon aboard in Argostolini bay enjoying a late supper, as to my surprise airlines appear to no longer feed you on board. It showed how far behind the times I was, and a further surprise was a severe downpour of wind and rain in the night. Perhaps the Mediterranean was not going to be such a pushover after all!\nApproaching the first anchorage  |  Photo credit: Bob Shepton\nOver the next day or two more crew gradually arrived. Each two-week leg through the summer had mostly new crews joining. The reasons why the crews, mainly of young people, were coming were also varied, from some writing their thesis on the basis of the research \u2013 it was Project Manaia \u2013\nMarine Research Expeditions\n, after all \u2013 to some having a spare couple of weeks and just liking the idea of sailing and helping the environment. There was quite a mix of nationalities as well.\nThe Boat\nThe boat, a steel 19m schooner that rejoiced in the name of\nWaya Waya\n, was well fitted out for sailing. The rig comprised a furling genoa, with a hanked-on staysail just behind, and then a large insert sail (inter) between the two masts (the boom had been removed), or a small inter sail, and then a mainsail on a boom on the aft mast. So, there were plenty of options to choose from for sailing. But then what seemed extraordinary to a conventional sailor like me, the wheel was entirely unprotected by any form of sprayhood, nor was there any seat or barrier to lean against when steering. There was however, a chart plotter and a powerful autohelm. Clearly heavy weather sailing was to be avoided if possible, and it worked fine in light conditions, though if I had been standing at the wheel for as long as the skipper did, I would have wanted somewhere closer to sit than the side benches.\nSlipping down below there was a slight problem re ventilation. This relied on hatches being open but in stormy or rainy conditions these had to be closed. Perhaps something by way of Dorade ventilators would be useful? The skipper had done an excellent job fitting out down below over the years, and he did assure me that he was going to add a handrail fore and aft and athwartships, as at the moment it was easy to be thrown around in the spacious saloon. Something to hang onto when making your way around in the sleeping quarters would also be useful. The boat did have two heads which was helpful with such large crews. The bunks were wide and spacious though again I did miss having some form of leeboard or lee-cloth. It was becoming obvious that the whole emphasis was on the research in quiet conditions, but might not heavy weather be encountered even in the Mediterranean?\nAuthor and skipper discuss whether to raise the International Association of Cape Horner\u2019s burgee\nWe were anchored in Argostoli bay. I imagine it was typical of most Greek harbours: there were at least two huge three-deckers resting on two large hulls pretending to be yachts, there was a floating block of flats by way of a cruise ship, and then closer to us, more sensible monohulls and catamarans. It was some relief when the skipper checked out and we set sail, all 11 of us on board by now.\nIn Search of Seagrass\nWe only went some five miles to begin with and anchored up in a corner by some strange scoured-out sandstone cliffs. Research proceedings commenced. To one completely uninitiated like myself, this was of considerable interest and formed the basis of the research wherever we went. The aim was to examine the seabed by way of transects, that is in straight lines starting from the shore to 50m out, by snorkeling where necessary. Groups, generally of three persons working alongside each other, started from different places round the shore, and the item of basic interest was seagrass \u2013 how much of it was there, what state was it in, was anything feeding on it, or what was growing on it, who or what was using it? It rapidly became obvious that seagrass formed the basis of much underwater ecology. And here was I complaining that I wasn\u2019t allowed to put my anchor down in Loch Creran back home because of the seagrass!\nAll this was meticulously recorded in data banks when they got back to the boat, which were then open to universities and all interested bodies, of which there seemed to be quite a number. And this procedure was followed wherever we stopped and anchored, whether near a town or in open country. Sometimes it was a case of making new transepts, sometimes they were made over the top of old transepts so comparisons from former times could be made. Conscientious and meticulous research and recording was carried out each time. Lucky the water was warm and inviting for swimming.\nAcross the Med\nBut now the time had come for the sea passage, which had been the main attraction for me signing on. But should we go via Syracuse, Sicily, and then on to Malta, or to Malta direct? Let the wind decide. I had already been introduced to another form of data analysis, above the water this time. Folk on rotas were posted port, bow, starboard and aft with a writer to record any sightings of seabirds, how many and what type, and anything else of interest in the water such as dolphins. I have to confess I did sometimes think, give it a rest and let\u2019s get on with the sailing, but that was definitely me at fault. The whole aim of this boat was the research; the sailing was just a backup.\nSo, we set sail westwards for Sicily or Malta and very pleasant it was. From memory we had the main set on the aft boom with one reef in because of a high wind forecast (which did not materialise until later) and the small inter permanently set. Sometimes we had both the staysail and the genoa flying, sometimes just the genoa. The sun shone by day and the blue dome of the sky was clear except for the line of those small white puffy cumulus clouds along the horizon, a sure sign of fair weather. There was a watch system, the crew broken down into three groups under those of us who had done a little more sailing. Personally, I did find four-hour watches at night a bit of a strain, but then I had for years organised my crews into two-hour watches on my own boat. The skipper set it all up, put the course into the autohelm, and really all we had to do was to call him if anything changed. Not too exacting!\nWelcome to Sicily\nConditions did change. For a while we had to motor. Then back on sail and latterly the wind increased but we did not have to change the sail plan we had by then, genoa, big inter and reefed main. We could still hold a course for Syracuse on Sicily. We approached in the early hours, following down a flashing lighthouse, finally putting the engine on in the morning daylight to motor quite a way still to the shore, to put our anchor down. Welcome to Sicily.\nPlans for transects, cruising greece to malta  |  Photo credit: Bob Shepton\nAgain, at every stop transects were undertaken, and observations made round the boat when moving. Fontane Blanche and Porto Palo are names that come to mind where we stopped in Sicily, and we finally took our departure for Malta from Capo Passero on the southern tip. An uneventful 70nm crossing had us doing more transepts in Malta at Selmon, Ingiebeach and even in St Julien\u2019s Bay just north of Valletta, right off the town itself. But the skipper had been saving up the entrance to Valletta itself as the grand finale, and he was right, As we turned to face towards the town itself, we were confronted with a scene that had not changed in a thousand years. Those Knights Templar certainly did not want anybody to think it worthwhile to attack their city; massive walls and defences that have been there for centuries, untouched and unchanged. Were they also a solace in World War 2 to submariners returning from enduring yet another prolonged depth charge attack? Sidling past the ships of the Maltese navy to reach the marina after that was something of an anti-climax. But we duly took our designated position on an outside pontoon and that was the end of the sailing for me.\nSetting out to set up a transect  |  Photo credit: Bob Shepton\nI undertook one expedition in Malta, accompanied by the dear girl who was cook and anchor lady on board (I never quite understood how those two responsibilities married up!), who was a nurse and about the same age as my nursing granddaughter back home, so there was an immediate rapprochement. She kindly took me in hand and saw that I was alright throughout the trip, and now we went off by bus \u2013 an adventure in itself \u2013 to look for the site of the old military camp at the northern end of the island by Ghajn Tuffieha, where I had been stationed 70 years ago to the exact year! We thought we\nmight\nhave found the site, though with all the modern building and luxury hotels it was difficult to be sure.\nIn fact, the care, concern and attention of all the crew to having a 90-year oldie on board was superb and could not be bettered. So, what of the future \u2013 if I were to be invited again? It was a completely different form of sailing. I did catch myself wondering at one point whether a day or some time at least could be devoted to introducing these highly intelligent young people, some of whom had never sailed before, to the rudiments of sailing \u2013 steering the boat, setting the sails according to the wind direction and other basic points. It was only a passing thought; the whole purpose and basis of the project was the environmental research. I learnt a lot as a result but concluded it would probably be best to stick to sailing while being grateful there was hope for the planet yet!\nCruising Greece to Malta - group photo  |  Photo credit: Bob Shepton\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Cruising Stories\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nHow a Professional Mariner Met the World of Cruising\nHow to Sail the French Riviera on a Budget: Navigating Billionaire\u2019s Alley by Boat\nSailing Novels & Guides: How Sailors Use Marina Book Exchanges to Stay Stocked\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nRaising Children on a Boat: How a Life Under Sail Shapes Our Kids\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Credit: Premier Marinas\nAs far as locations go, the Premier Falmouth Marina is one of the most picturesque you\u2019ll find. It is also well appointed, and conveniently positioned for serious west country cruising and beyond, says Sue Pelling.\n50\u00b0 09\u201990N, 005\u00b005\u201902W\nThe vibrant and historic town of Falmouth in Cornwall, which is located within an area of outstanding natural beauty is one of the most desirable places to visit when cruising the west country. Given its popularity there are plenty of sheltered berthing options available including Premier\u2019s Falmouth Marina, which sits conveniently on the south bank up Penryn River.\nThe main Falmouth harbour, as you enter from the Channel \u2013 Carrick Roads \u2013 is one of the world\u2019s largest natural deep-water harbours and extends northwards as far as the River Fal. In the 18th century it became a bustling hub for packet ships carrying mail, and other commercial goods including\u00a0 timber, iron, coal, and charcoal. It was also an important harbour for the arrival of imported goods such as tea, spices and silks. Falmouth\u2019s defence role in both world wars was crucial too because it served as a base for anti-submarine operations as well as an embarkation point for the D-Day landings.\nFalmouth\u2019s rich maritime heritage continues to be celebrated to this day with events such as the Falmouth Regatta,\nFalmouth Classics\n, the Oyster Festival, and the Falmouth International Sea Shanty Festival taking place every year. Falmouth Marina is within easy walking distance to the main hub which is home to a vast array of independent shops, restaurants and attractions such as Discovery Quay, the National Maritime Museum, and Pendennis Castle.\nWhen you arrive at the marina you can be sure of a warm welcome by Premier\u2019s staff who are on hand 24-hours a day to assist you with your berthing, and any help you require with facilities. As with all Premier Marinas, Falmouth Marina is well designed and laid out for ease of use. It has two berthing areas, with space for boats up to 18m loa on its outer pontoons, and up to 15m loa in its inner basin. For convenience it has a chandlery and restaurant (UpperDeck), and fuel bay for diesel onsite, and has a full-service boatyard as well as a range of businesses including a sailmaker, marine electronic specialist, a rigger, and a yacht broker.\nAnnual berth holders can also benefit from Premier Advantage, which offers a package of rewards, benefits and cost savings including 42 free visitor nights and unlimited short stays at any Premier marina, Sea Start benefits and savings, fuel at cost, special deals on insurance, and up to eight.\nPassage Planning\nThe marina\u2019s location on the south bank of the Penryn River (the first creek you see on the western side of the Fal Estuary) offers easy access but if your boat has a draft of 1.7m, avoid making the approach within 1.5 hours of low water springs. The channel is buoyed and the general approach to the marina is straightforward but it is, however, advisable to consult up-to-date charts, and check notes to mariners at the time of arrival in case of any changes.\nThe access channel is to the southwest of the east cardinal mark. Travel upstream, leaving Greenbank Quay to port. You will see the marina as you pass Boyers Cellars \u2013 a deep-water commercial jetty. Steer close to the marina\u2019s outer pontoons, keeping between them and the east cardinal beacon, which shows the edge of the dredged area.\nWhen you arrive, moor at the visitors\u2019 hammerhead pontoon and call up reception on VHF Ch80 or using the pontoon telephone for berth allocation.\nIt is also worth noting the marina is divided in two by a cill that is marked at each end by a tide gauge. The cill dries to 1.8m above Chart Datum and visitors should only enter the inner basin after being given the go-ahead by marina staff. Finally, if you are a visitor, Premier says it strongly advises pre-booking, especially in peak season because it gives priority access to Premier berth holders visiting from other marinas.\nCruising Grounds\nOnce in the Fal estuary and you base yourself at the marina, you have 12nm of cruising options, stretching as far as the cathedral city of Truro, to explore. With beautiful wooded shorelines and plenty of creeks and places of interest to visit along the way, there\u2019s hardly any need to go anywhere else. Take a sail round to Trelissick for example, where you can anchor off and visit the National Trust Trelissick house and gardens and enjoy the spectacular views. If you are intending to venture further afield to places like the Isles of Scilly, which is approximately 60nm away, or across the Channel, it\u2019s an ideal safe, sheltered base. There are plenty of popular shorter passages on the \u2018doorstep\u2019 too including (to the east) the pretty town of Fowey just 20nm away, Plymouth 38nm away, or Salcombe in Devon 50nm. One of the most delightful places just south around the headland is the Helford River. This is a gem of a place to explore because it\u2019s off the beaten track and offers stunning scenery, plenty of interesting anchorages, and attractive beaches particularly on the north shore of the Helford estuary.\nFurther afield, Jersey and the Channel Islands are logical destinations.\nPremier Falmouth Marina Factfile\nPostcode:\nTR11 2TD\nVHF:\nCh80\nWebsite:\npremiermarinas.com\nEmail:\nfalmouth@premiermarinas.com\nTel:\n+44(0)1326 316 620\nReception open:\n24-hours\nBerthing fees:\nPrices\nPremier Falmouth Marina: Annual Fees\nSmall Boat\n\u2264 6.5m (inside cill) from \u00a32,999 p/a\n>6.5m from \u00a3650 p/m\nSeasonal (min 30 nights)\nOffpeak (Sept-May) from \u00a393.97 p/m\nPeak (June-Aug) from \u00a3104.41 p/m\nVisitor berthing (8m min charge)\nFrom \u00a34.50 p/m p/n\nShort stay (up to 4 hours, 8m min charge)\n\u00a31.60 p/m\nMarina Services\nElectricity: \u00a332.75 p/u\nWater: free of charge\nWifi: Free of charge\nLaundry: Token operated\nFuel: Diesel (call +44(0)1326 316 620)\nBottled Gas: Chandlery\nMarine engineers and workshops: Onsite\nLift out/in: available\nOnsite Businesses\nChandlery: Falmouth Chandlers: +44(0)1326 212411\nBroker: Ancaster +44(0)1326 211007\nRigger/Sailmaking: A2 Rigging, Sails & Covers\u00a0 +44(0)1326 221133\nMarine Engineer/Electrical: Andrew Cox Marine +44(0)7974 250533\nMarine Electronics: BT Marine +44(0)7977 026526\nPlaces to Eat and Drink\nUpperDeck (onsite): +44(0)1326 313481\nIndidog: +44(0)1326 450 699\nThe Shed: +44(0)1326 318502\nThe Greenbank: +44 (0)1326 312440\nThe Boathouse +44 (0)1326 315425\nSupermaket: Sainsburys TR11 2RZ (5 min walk)\nNearest railway station: Penmere\u00a0 (20 min walk)\nTaxis: Taxi A2B Falmouth: +44 (0)1326 317898\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Destinations\nIonian Sailing in Autumn: Guide to Exploring Greek Islands in the Off-Season\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nGuide to Cruising Ithaca: Greek Charter Destinations\nSailing in Corsica, Sardinia & Sicily: Mediterranean Chartering\nChartering in Spain: Guide to Spanish Coast & Balearic Island\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

What does the company do, and how did it get started?\nVentureSail\noffers a variety of fully crewed sailing experiences across a fleet of unique and interesting vessels, run by passionate seafarers worldwide. Most of our boats are owner-operated, providing guests with access to first-hand knowledge of a location and the opportunity to learn from very experienced crews. Guests can join in without ever having set foot on a boat before.\nThe agency was started in 2018 after working with Nikki Alford, skipper and owner of\nhistoric ship Bessie Ellen\n. We identified a need to support vessels and operators like hers at sea, who struggle to respond to emails or navigate modern-day marketing for their bookings. So we created a bespoke agency that represented this unique type of charter holiday. We built the website and booking engine from scratch, enabling us to tailor our processes and marketing to each boat\u2019s unique needs.\nWhat is your role within VentureSail, and how did you get started in the role? Have you always been into sailing?\nI\u2019m Cornish, so the sea has always played a big part in my life, but I came to sailing later in life when water skiing was no longer good for me. I\u2019m the managing director and founder of the company with a strong background in marketing and tech. I closed my marketing agency during COVID to focus on this business full-time, with the goal of expanding the charter holiday sector. Although this is a fairly niche business, we have now expanded into European markets and work with operators from all over the world. We are still based in Cornwall, with an all-female team, but have a global vision, we sail with all our boats and have a great work-life balance by the sea.\nWhat are the challenges and rewards of working in this sector of the marine industry?\nOf course, when your business is determined by weather, there are naturally challenges, with fast-paced decisions that have to be made to ensure guests have the best experience. The rewards are immeasurable, though. A particular reward for us is having so many first-time customers who get completely hooked on sailing and have continued on to cross the Atlantic. We are also proud that so many experienced sailors choose to join us around the world. Whether it\u2019s guests who have previously owned their own boat, but now want the headaches of route planning and paperwork taken care of, or guests who did their day skipper 25 years ago, once onboard everyone\u2019s skill level comes together to work as a team - an experience that you can only get whilst sailing!\nAre there any routes or itineraries that are especially popular with clients at present, or any you are looking to promote?\nWe have seen growth in our mile-builder trips, which offer more days and nights at sea to gain experience. From hopping over the English Channel to sailing the length of the UK and crossing the Atlantic, time away from it all with no digital connection is becoming more popular. For some, it\u2019s an alternative to travelling to different locations without flying. Sustainable slow travel wasn\u2019t a major consideration five years ago, but it has become a factor in people\u2019s decision-making when planning a holiday. Solo travellers now make up 40% of our customer base, with equal proportions of men and women joining our boats alone. There is definitely a specific type of customer that joins our trips, so you are bound to meet like-minded people.\nHow do you see the state of the industry at present? Are there reasons to be cheerful?\nThere is an increasing amount of legislation changes from our own MCA and other countries\u2019 marine authorities. Sailing in some areas of Europe and the world has become a paperwork nightmare for charter sector operators, and it\u2019s getting increasingly difficult for the historic fleet to make ends meet with so many cost increases, which is worrying for their futures. But we see nothing but growth in our little corner of the market, as people want to escape the ordinary and use their well-earned time off to try something completely different that\u2019s perhaps out of their comfort zone.\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Charter Tips\nAdventure Sailing Holiday Guide: Where to Find Thrilling Charter Experiences\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nHow to Go Racing in the Caribbean: Chartering for All Skill Levels\nYacht Ownership Scheme Guide: Fractional & Shared Ownership\nWhat Is the Secret to Sunsail\u2019s Success?\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

The first 46.4-metre unit will be available in early 2029.\nThe new model comes as an evolution of the popular 40.9-metre DOM133 line, which has 12 units sold, and the 34.5-metre DOM115 line, which has four new build orders to date. Characterised by a sub-500GT volume, the new displacement motor yacht follows the previous models' Roman domus concept of \"warm, welcoming and refined\", now expanded with larger volumes and \"enhanced liveability\".\nItalian designer and long-time Baglietto collaborator\nStefano Vafiadis\nhas returned for the design of the DOM155. Vafiadis describes the design as \u201cclean and sculptural,\" while \u201cnever excessive, yet balanced and aggressive at the same time, featuring longitudinal cuts and taut volumes inspired by automotive design.\u201d\nTaking inspiration from the DOM133, the DOM155 features generous volumes, floor-to-ceiling glazing and a \"seamless dialogue\" between interior and exterior spaces.\nThe main focus of the model is found in the stern. Dedicated to relaxation and well-being, the space features a central panoramic infinity pool with steps on either side leading to the aft cockpit. This space can be configured with a spa and gym overlooking the sea, thanks to a fold-down port-side shell door, or as an additional tender garage if desired.\nThe aft swimming platform also features a large transformer for swimming and easy dock access\nInside, living areas comprise a main deck saloon with a dining table for ten guests aft, and an upper deck saloon which opens on three sides for panoramic views. Also on the main deck is the owner's suite, which spans the yacht's full beam and is fitted with a walk-in closet, a master bedroom with a California king-size bed and a spacious his-and-hers en suite with a \"walk-through\" shower.\nFour en suite guest cabins are located on the lower deck, forward of which is accommodation for a crew of eight in addition to a crew mess and laundry area. An additional guest cabin can also be incorporated on the upper deck if desired.\nOther lounge spaces on board can be found forward of the wheelhouse (near a technical area housing a tender and jet ski) and a 130-square-metre sundeck fitted with sunbathing areas, a \"conversation lounge\" and an infinity pool with an integrated bar.\n4 images\nThe latest DOM 133 yacht\nSui Generis\nwas launched in July 2025\nIn keeping with the DOM133, aluminium has been chosen as the construction material for the DOM155, allowing for greater customisation alongside improved performance and a shallow draught. As such, the project is particularly appealing to the American market, of which the La Spezia\u2013based shipyard notes as one of its most important markets.\n\u201cThe DOM155 is the result of listening carefully to our clients and, more broadly, to the market, which has enthusiastically welcomed both the 35- and 41-metre models but has repeatedly expressed interest in larger dimensions,\u201d explained Baglietto\u2019s chief commercial officer, Fabio Ermetto.\nHe continued: \u201cThis project, developed together with architect Stefano Vafiadis, brings together many of the improvement suggestions and experiences shared by our owners over the years, resulting in a yacht with high levels of customisation, comfort, and liveability that we are confident will fit perfectly into the sub-500 GT yacht segment.\u201d\nThe DOM155 will be powered by twin CAT C32 engines, capable of reaching a 16-knot maximum speed.\nAccording to\nBOATPro\n, Baglietto currently has 18 yachts on order or under construction, including three 60-metre T60 yacht models.\nRead More\n/\nThe bigger, bolder sister: A closer look at Baglietto\u2019s T60 superyacht in build\nSign up to BOAT Briefing email\nLatest news, brokerage headlines and yacht exclusives, every weekday\nSubmit\nSimilar yachts for sale\nNEW MASTER\nBaglietto\n44.46\nm \u2022\n12\nguests\n\u20ac7,000,000\nGRAND CRU\nBaglietto\n48.9\nm \u2022\n14\nguests\n$6,800,000\nMore stories\nConstruction begins on first Lazzara UHV 160 with H2 Yacht Design interiors\nFirst 24m Bering 78 explorer yacht Slow Ride launched\n31m rebuilt sailing yacht Palm Beach XI marks delivery with Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race\nLogos: ER Yacht Design unveils latest yacht concept with motion appearance\nThree yachts sink following marina fire in Sydney, Australia\nVan der Valk begins construction on custom 30m Project Berlin\nMost popular\nKoru: The best photos of Jeff Bezos\u2019 record-breaking sailing yacht\nInside Hodor: The mind-blowing superyacht support vessel with toys for every terrain\nEverything we know about the Bayesian yacht tragedy one year on\nChristina O: What happened to Aristotle Onassis' 99m superyacht?\nOn board L\u00fcrssen's 122m Kismet, the Motor Yacht of the Year 2025\nRoman shipwrecks, bioluminescent turtles and other amazing discoveries made by superyachts\nNero: On board the 90m superyacht that's an exact replica of a classic\nAn open mind: On board Alia Yachts' dayboat-inspired superyacht SAN\nThe story of the crew member who struck gold and became a superyacht owner\n\"The big dog on the SpaceCat!\": Inside the futuristic catamaran featured in The White Lotus\nPredator: the speed-optimised superyacht that got a design carte blanche from her captain\nThis Is It: On board the radical 43m catamaran that emerged from a daring brief\nFrom our partners\nIs this the most radical 200GT motor yacht ever built?\nTalk to your yacht: Sirena introduces voice-controlled AI across its fleet with Vanemar and Garmin\nExploring Asia: The new luxury ocean travel experience setting sail in 2027-2028\nUninterrupted internet at sea: A complete guide to hybrid superyacht connectivity\nWhy Panama is the superyacht destination you\u2019ve been overlooking\nThe luxury entertainment brand every superyacht owner should know\nSponsored listings\nMISS MICHELLE\nHorizon\n\u2022\n37.2\nm \u2022\n8\nguests \u2022\n$16,450,000\nSEVEN SINS\nSanlorenzo\n\u2022\n52\nm \u2022\n11\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac28,000,000\nNIKKI BELLA\nViking\n\u2022\n27.43\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n$15,475,000\nEmina\nBenetti\n\u2022\n42.67\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$16,950,000\nSEAWOLF X\nRossinavi\n\u2022\n42.84\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac36,900,000\nBOUJIE\nViking\n\u2022\n24.99\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$12,145,000\nFIVE WAVES\nAB Yachts - Next Yacht Group\n\u2022\n35.99\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$4,250,000\nCHECKMATE\nBenetti\n\u2022\n44.2\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac10,900,000\nSubscribe to Newsletters\nSubscribe to Newsletters\nAdvertising & Media Kit\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nMore from BOAT International\nYachts\nYachts For Sale\nCharter\nDestinations\nBoat Life\nBoat Presents\nEvents\nBOATPro\nShop\nSite Map\nbcreative.studio\nFollow us on\nSubscribe\nSign up to our newsletters\nSign up to BOAT International email newsletters to get the latest superyacht news, business analysis, exclusive event invitations, and more.\nSign up\nBACK TO TOP\nBoat International Media Ltd \u00a9 2008 - 2025.\nContent presented under the \"BOAT Presents\" logo is an advertising feature and Boat International Limited has been paid to include this content.",

Major technical and interior milestones have now been completed and the superyacht is on track for her scheduled 2026 delivery.\nAccording to the shipyard, works are now progressing on all plumbing, piping and technical installations alongside the production of teak decking and paint preparation. The new build will then undergo engine installation, paint completion and interior joinery ahead of her launch, sea trials and handover this year.\nThe model \u2013 penned by Sirena\u2019s in-house design team \u2013 was first unveiled at the 2024\nMonaco Yacht Show\nas the largest in the shipyard\u2019s composite line, built entirely in GRP with a sub-300GT volume and a flexible tri-deck layout.\n7 images\nDutch designer\nCor D. Rover\nis the brain behind the model's customisable interior design, which is said by the yard to be \"contemporary-styled\" and \"highly elegant\". Rover has used an \"understated yet elegant\" colour scheme, wood veneer applications and integrated soft lighting to create a sophisticated yet inviting ambience.\nCream upholstery, light wood tones and bronze accents characterise the decor - also chosen to help accentuate the spaces\u2019 natural light, which, according to the yard, evolves from day to night with the glow from the rising to the setting sun.\nAccommodation is for up to 12 guests and seven crew on board, with the guest accommodation comprising a VIP suite and four guest cabins on the lower deck. The shipyard has dedicated significant attention to the owner's area, which is located forward on the main deck and can extend across two decks in a \"loft\" option. A spiral staircase connects to a private relaxation space on the lower deck, which features a fold-down balcony.\nThere are plenty of social areas across the model's design, including an informal dining and lounging area on the main deck aft, outfitted with curvaceous contemporary furniture and curated fittings, while further dining and a wet bar can be found on the upper deck. Meanwhile, a Jacuzzi sits in the yacht's bow, flanked by sunpads and loungers.\nWith naval architecture by respected Argentinian naval architect\nGerm\u00e1n Frers\n, a fast displacement hull will give her a top speed of 16 knots, propelled by twin MAN V12 3,100hp engines. With a more powerful 3,800hp package, she will deliver a top speed of 21 knots.\n\u201cAs the first Sirena 118 continues to take shape, we are proud to see the design vision materialising across every area of the build,\u201d shared Sirena Yachts CEO, \u00c7a\u011fin Genc. \u201cThe craftsmanship of our team, together with our long-standing partners such as Cor D. Rover and Germ\u00e1n Frers, is bringing this new flagship to life in a way that truly reflects the spirit of Sirena.\u201d\nThe Turkish yard is also working towards the completion of its flagship yacht \u2013\u00a0created in collaboration with\nLuca Vallebona\nand\nHot Lab\n\u2013 which is currently under construction in Yalova, Turkey, with delivery also scheduled for 2026.\nRead More\n/\nSirena Yachts' 42m flagship hits milestone ahead of 2026 launch\nSign up to BOAT Briefing email\nLatest news, brokerage headlines and yacht exclusives, every weekday\nSubmit\nSimilar yachts for sale\nHeliophilia\nSirena Yachts\n26.82\nm \u2022\n12\nguests\n\u20ac7,750,000\nSIRENA 118\nSirena Yachts\n36\nm \u2022\n12\nguests\n\u20ac15,500,000\nMore stories\n\u20ac2M price drop on 30m hybrid Royal Huisman sailing yacht Foftein\nDOM155: Baglietto unveils 46m flagship DOM line yacht model\nConstruction begins on first Lazzara UHV 160 with H2 Yacht Design interiors\nFirst 24m Bering 78 explorer yacht Slow Ride launched\n31m rebuilt sailing yacht Palm Beach XI marks delivery with Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race\nLogos: ER Yacht Design unveils latest yacht concept with motion appearance\nMost popular\nKoru: The best photos of Jeff Bezos\u2019 record-breaking sailing yacht\nInside Hodor: The mind-blowing superyacht support vessel with toys for every terrain\nEverything we know about the Bayesian yacht tragedy one year on\nChristina O: What happened to Aristotle Onassis' 99m superyacht?\nOn board L\u00fcrssen's 122m Kismet, the Motor Yacht of the Year 2025\nRoman shipwrecks, bioluminescent turtles and other amazing discoveries made by superyachts\nNero: On board the 90m superyacht that's an exact replica of a classic\nAn open mind: On board Alia Yachts' dayboat-inspired superyacht SAN\nThe story of the crew member who struck gold and became a superyacht owner\n\"The big dog on the SpaceCat!\": Inside the futuristic catamaran featured in The White Lotus\nPredator: the speed-optimised superyacht that got a design carte blanche from her captain\nThis Is It: On board the radical 43m catamaran that emerged from a daring brief\nFrom our partners\nIs this the most radical 200GT motor yacht ever built?\nExploring Asia: The new luxury ocean travel experience setting sail in 2027-2028\nQuick Group unveils major upgrades to its gyro stabilisers and next-generation SeaCentric system\nTalk to your yacht: Sirena introduces voice-controlled AI across its fleet with Vanemar and Garmin\nThe luxury entertainment brand every superyacht owner should know\nInside Frida: The latest 55m on-spec Heesen awaiting an owner\u2019s personal touch\nSponsored listings\nMISS MICHELLE\nHorizon\n\u2022\n37.2\nm \u2022\n8\nguests \u2022\n$16,450,000\nSEVEN SINS\nSanlorenzo\n\u2022\n52\nm \u2022\n11\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac28,000,000\nNIKKI BELLA\nViking\n\u2022\n27.43\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n$15,475,000\nEmina\nBenetti\n\u2022\n42.67\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$16,950,000\nSEAWOLF X\nRossinavi\n\u2022\n42.84\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac36,900,000\nBOUJIE\nViking\n\u2022\n24.99\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$12,145,000\nFIVE WAVES\nAB Yachts - Next Yacht Group\n\u2022\n35.99\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$4,250,000\nCHECKMATE\nBenetti\n\u2022\n44.2\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac10,900,000\nSubscribe to Newsletters\nSubscribe to Newsletters\nAdvertising & Media Kit\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nMore from BOAT International\nYachts\nYachts For Sale\nCharter\nDestinations\nBoat Life\nBoat Presents\nEvents\nBOATPro\nShop\nSite Map\nbcreative.studio\nFollow us on\nSubscribe\nSign up to our newsletters\nSign up to BOAT International email newsletters to get the latest superyacht news, business analysis, exclusive event invitations, and more.\nSign up\nBACK TO TOP\nBoat International Media Ltd \u00a9 2008 - 2025.\nContent presented under the \"BOAT Presents\" logo is an advertising feature and Boat International Limited has been paid to include this content.",

It has been designed to shorten processing timelines and transform the information-seeking journey into a smooth, reliable and fully integrated digital experience. The guide also includes a comprehensive FAQ section, along with clear, advisory-based guidance outlining permitted and prohibited practices.\nThe first series of the guide is dedicated to yachting activities, offering a clear and practical end-to-end pathway for a yacht\u2019s journey from arrival to departure. This includes procedures, documentation, licenses and permits, mechanisms for identifying and confirming the port of entry (port/marina) through a licensed agent, as well as directories of approved service providers (maritime tourism agents, yacht charter companies and marinas). It also includes safety and environmental sustainability guidelines, alongside periodic updates of regulatory requirements.\nAMAALA Triple Bay\n\"The significance of the guide stems from its role as a foundational enabler for the coastal tourism activities sector, one of the key drivers of tourism growth,\" the SRSA stated. \"Its launch is the result of intensive coordination efforts led by the Authority in collaboration with relevant entities to ensure role integration, foster an attractive tourism and investment environment, support the\u00a0sector\u2019s accelerating growth and align with the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030.\"\nThe announcement forms part of a broader effort to enhance yachting activity within Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea.\nBOATPro\nrecently spoke with the CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority (STA) to learn more about the country\u2019s bold plans for transforming the yachting landscape and the future of tourism in the region.\nRead More\n/\nInterview: Saudi Tourism Authority on positioning the Red Sea as superyachting's next frontier\nSign up to BOATPro News\nYes, please send me BOATPro News email newsletter, delivered every Wednesday.\nSubmit\nRead more\nMarinas\nSafe Harbor acquires Front Street Shipyard\nboat_pro_news\nMarinas\nBlackstone to acquire Hamilton Island resort in Australia\nboat_pro_news\nIn review\nThe most travelled yachts of 2025\nboat_pro_news\nFinancial results\nOyster Yachts reports improved FY25 results amid turnaround\nboat_pro_news\nUAE\nForeign yachts now able to move freely between Abu Dhabi and Dubai\nboat_pro_news\nBrokerage report\nDecember sales up 66% year on year\nboat_pro_news\nFrom our partners\nPershing turns 40: Celebrating a rich history and revealing what lies ahead\nIs this the most radical 200GT motor yacht ever built?\nThe luxury entertainment brand every superyacht owner should know\nUninterrupted internet at sea: A complete guide to hybrid superyacht connectivity\nWhy Panama is the superyacht destination you\u2019ve been overlooking\nTalk to your yacht: Sirena introduces voice-controlled AI across its fleet with Vanemar and Garmin\nAdvertising & Media Kit\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nMore from BOAT International\nYachts\nYachts For Sale\nCharter\nDestinations\nBoat Life\nBoat Presents\nEvents\nBOATPro\nShop\nSite Map\nbcreative.studio\nFollow us on\nSubscribe\nSign up to our newsletters\nSign up to BOAT International email newsletters to get the latest superyacht news, business analysis, exclusive event invitations, and more.\nSign up\nBACK TO TOP\nBoat International Media Ltd \u00a9 2008 - 2025.\nContent presented under the \"BOAT Presents\" logo is an advertising feature and Boat International Limited has been paid to include this content.",
