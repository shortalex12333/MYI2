The primary difference between them is their maturity dates and the frequency of interest payments. Treasury bills have the shortest maturities, ranging from four weeks to one year, and they only pay interest when they mature. Treasury notes are issued with maturities ranging from two to 10 years, and pay interest every six months. And Treasury bonds mature in either 20 or 30 years, also paying interest every six months.\nLearn More:\nTreasury Bonds vs. Treasury Notes vs. Treasury Bills: What\u2019s the Difference?\nCan inverted yield curves predict recessions?\nAn inverted yield curve is widely considered one of the most reliable indicators of an impending recession. An inverted yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession since 1955 with only one false alarm. Though the inverted yield curve observed in 2019, which preceded the short recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, should hardly be interpreted as a predictor of that recession.\nLearn More:\nThe Impact of an Inverted Yield Curve\nWhy are bond prices and yields negatively correlated?\nBond yields move in the opposite direction of prices because the bond\u2019s coupon rate is fixed but the appeal of that bond and its coupon rate on the secondary market changes with economic conditions. If interest rates rise, bonds issued with lower coupon rates become less attractive to potential buyers, who could get a higher rate of return on a new bond. Subsequently, the bond\u2019s price declines. An investor who buys that bond at a discount will receive coupon payments on the bond\u2019s face value, not its market value, meaning their return will be greater than the official coupon rate. Yields decrease as bond prices rise for the same reason.\nLearn More:\nUnderstanding Bond Prices and Yields\nHow do I cash in my U.S. Savings Bond?\nYou can cash in most paper U.S. Savings Bond at a bank or credit union. The exception is Series HH bonds, which were discontinued in 2004. These need to be mailed to Treasury Retail Securities Services with a specific form. Electronic bonds can be cashed in online at Treasury Direct, which will transfer the proceeds to your checking or savings account within a couple of days.\nLearn More:\nHow to Cash In Your U.S. Savings Bonds\nKey Terms\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)\nBasis Points\nRepurchase Agreement (Repo)\nYield Curve\nDebenture\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are U.S. Treasury securities that are pegged to inflation. They are meant to preserve the purchasing power of the investor\u2019s principal.\nLearn More\nBasis Points\nA basis point is a unit of measurement for interest rates and other percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of a percent, or 0.01%.\nLearn More\nRepurchase Agreement (Repo)\nA repurchase agreement (repo) is a short-term borrowing arrangement in which a dealer sells government securities to investors with the guarantee they will buy them back shortly after (usually the next day) at a slightly higher price.\nLearn More\nYield Curve\nA yield curve is a line connecting the yields on bonds of equal credit quality but different maturities as plotted on a graph. The slope of the yield curve signals expectations of future interest rates and economic activity. A normal yield curve slopes upward since bonds with longer maturities usually have higher yields. When the yields on short-term bonds exceed those on long-term debt, the yield curve is said to be inverted.\nLearn More\nDebenture\nA debenture is an unsecured loan certificate representing debt that is backed by creditworthiness rather than assets.\nLearn More\nWhy Foreign Bonds Could Be a Game-Changer for Investors\nWhich Countries Hold the Highest Credit Ratings?\n'Bond Vigilantes' Are Back.

Your financial life is filled with personal decisions and challenges. Whether you are investing as a beginner or expert, planning your retirement, buying a home, studying for an exam in business school, or running a small business, you have questions that need answering.\nFor over 25 years, we\u2019ve helped hundreds of millions of people do just that. We feel it\u2019s important to share how we go about writing all of the articles that you depend on.\nImportant\nAt Investopedia we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT.\nPrinciples\nEmpowering:\nFinance can be complex and intimidating. We provide you with information that you can use with confidence, whatever your level of experience.\nUnbiased:\nFrom financial product recommendations to the financial implications of government policy we put things in context and provide all the facts. Our information is carefully researched and is not written to support any specific economic or political viewpoint.\nAccurate:\nHaving accurate financial information, presented clearly and updated regularly is of the utmost importance to us. We seek out and work with the most qualified experts across every topic we cover. Any mistakes, inaccuracies, or misrepresentations identified by our readers are investigated and corrected promptly. Please contact us at inv_editorial@investopedia.com if you have any questions or feedback.\nInclusive:\nWe work to ensure that our content serves\u2014and depicts with dignity and respect\u2014people of different ages, nationalities, religions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, relationship statuses, physical and mental abilities, and family types.\nEthics\nWe are committed to following the\nCodes of Ethics\nof the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing (SABEW). Our content is guided by and upholds the\nSociety for Professional Journalists\u2019 foundations of ethical journalism\n: being accurate and fair, minimizing harm, acting independently, and being accountable and transparent. We also uphold the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines on disclosures\n, where applicable.\nInvestopedia content is for informational purposes and is not intended to substitute for the advice of a licensed or certified attorney, accountant, financial advisor, or other certified financial professionals.\nEditorial Process\nOur staff of editors and network of expert contributors write and manage all the articles you find on Investopedia. We don\u2019t make recommendations for you to buy, sell, or hold securities or investments. We do, however, provide relevant analysis, context, insights, and educational information to help you make smarter, better-informed decisions. Wherever possible we provide examples that help put complex topics and concepts into perspective.\nOur editorial team is continually evaluating the articles across our site to flag any that contain information that is known to be or is likely to be out-of-date. Such articles are reviewed and updated or, if necessary, completely rewritten, rechecked, and re-edited. Our network of experienced experts, who uphold our process and policies, assist with our updating efforts. Articles that have been updated are date-stamped to reflect this.\nQuality Standards\nEvery article you see has multiple people behind it, continually working to make sure that it is responsible, accurate, understandable, helpful, and reflective of our editorial principles.\nOur editorial team\napproves all story ideas independently, and our expert contributors each have deep subject matter expertise in the topics that we assign them. Our team of professional editors, fact checkers, and producers review content to ensure it upholds our values of being empowering, inclusive, unbiased, and accurate.\nAll staff are responsible for disclosing any potential conflicts of interest.\nCorrections\nInvestopedia is committed to telling readers when an error has appeared, and to correcting it. This transparency applies to small and large mistakes, including news, but only if an error was made at the time of original publication. Corrections will be clearly noted on the page. When our journalism is factually correct, but the language is not as clear or detailed as necessary, the story may be updated without an editor's note.\u00a0Please report possible errors to inv_editorial@investopedia.com.\nWriters\nInvestopedia experts are carefully recruited, vetted, and chosen. Some are experienced financial writers, others are experts in particular aspects of finance; many are both. They are selected for their knowledge and skill in communicating complex topics in clear, accessible, actionable language.\nEvery article\u2019s author or reviewer is listed at the top of the page, to the left of the date, and is linked to their biography, which you can click on to learn more about their credentials, education, professional experience, and social media presence.\nAll writers are required to uphold the editorial guidelines listed above.\nThird-Party Content\nWe do not publish third-party content on Investopedia. All recommendations on Investopedia are made by the staff editors and research analysts. Investopedia is not influenced by partnerships, companies, or third-party organizations, though we may review their information during our literature review and competitive analysis work before creating rubrics and outlines for our projects and content. Our sources for our content are primary sources and can be seen on methodology pages, and in inline citations, as well as through attribution directly in the articles. You can read more about our\nproduct and services review policy here\n.\nWarranty and Liability Disclaimer\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only and should not be considered individual investment advice or recommendations to invest in any security or adopt any investment strategy. Though we believe the information provided herein is reliable, we do not warrant its accuracy or completeness. The views and strategies described in our content may not be suitable for all investors. Because market and economic conditions are subject to rapid change, all comments, opinions, and analyses contained within our content are rendered as of the date of the posting and may change without notice. The material is not intended as a complete analysis of every material fact regarding any country, region, market, industry, investment, or strategy.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and cryptocurrency-related content on Investopedia is not a recommendation to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs. Since each individual's situation is unique, a qualified professional should always be consulted before making any financial decisions. Investopedia makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or timeliness of the information contained herein.\nAdvertising Disclosure\nUpdated June 12, 2020\nInvestopedia accepts advertising, but maintains a strict and clear separation between advertising and editorial content. Special attention is paid to featuring advertising in a way that will not interfere with your reading experience. This relates to both page design and to the number of ads we choose to feature on a page.\nInvestopedia maintains a distinct separation between advertising and editorial content.\nAll advertising or sponsored content on Investopedia is clearly and unambiguously distinguished from editorial content through borders or other distinguishing elements and/or identified as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.\nAll ads on Investopedia are labeled as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.\nAll \"native\" ads or paid content are identified as an \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" \"Sponsored\" or a similar designation indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of the sponsor.\nEditorial content on Investopedia is not influenced by advertisements unless the content is sponsored content, in which case, the content will be clearly demarcated and identified with the title \"Ad,\" \"Advertisement,\" or \"Sponsored\", or a similar designation, indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of an advertiser or sponsor.\nIn some cases, editorial may include links to partners for which Investopedia receives an affiliate commission (See \u2018How We Make Money\u2019 for more details). The placement of these links is not influenced by payment, and editorial reserves the right to change, modify or remove them at any time in order to provide the best experience to users.\nHow We Make Money\nThe way that we're able to offer over 30,000 articles of great content on our website for free is by partnering with advertisers and affiliate partners who are looking to reach consumers. This can take a number of different forms, and we'll walk through those below. It's important to note that we maintain strict editorial independence for all of our content, particularly on reviews and recommendations. If a product is great, we'll tell you even if we don't have an advertising relationship. If we think a product is bad, we'll tell you that, even if we DO have an advertising relationship with them. While we do recommend and review products regardless of any advertising relationships, we may not have reviewed every product available in a given category.\nAffiliate Links to Advertisers\nIn some cases we may have an affiliate relationship with a product that we review, and so when you click on an \"Open Account\" button or sometimes a hyperlink on the product's name in those cases we may receive compensation either when you click on it it or if you decide to sign up for the product. Whether or not we have an advertiser in place does not change the placement of the button or whether there's a link for you to go to their website.\nExample of a broker review with a product card featuring an Open Account button, for which we may receive compensation when you click it or if you sign up for the product.\nComparison/Rate Tables Featuring Advertisers\nOn some review/recommendations we may include a comparison table of products that are offers from advertisers. While we do work hard with partners to try and surface the best paid offers possible in these comparison tables, it's important to note that they are NOT editorially selected. Here's an example of what that can look like, notice the Advertising Disclosure link in the top right corner:\nComparison tables featuring advertisers will always have their own Advertising Disclosure on them.\nDisplay Ads\nSome review/recommendations may include display advertising on them, which will be labelled as advertisements and are easily recognized.\nExample of traditional display advertisements on a bank review.\nInvestopedia\nNewsletter Sign Up\nFollow Us\nNews\nInvesting\nSimulator\nBanking\nPersonal Finance\nEconomy\nReviews\nDictionary\nAbout Us\nEditorial Process\nCareers\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nAdvertise\nYour Privacy Choices\n#\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\nY\nZ\nInvestopedia\nis part of the\nPeople Inc.\npublishing\u00a0family.\nNewsletter Sign Up\nNewsletter Sign Up\nBy clicking \u201cAccept All Cookies\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.\nCookies Settings\nAccept All Cookies",

They are traded between consenting parties with no broker and tracked on digital ledgers.\nCryptocurrency Essentials\nCryptocurrency Investment Guide: Steps and Strategies for Beginners\nBest Crypto Exchanges and Apps for January 2026\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Halving: Impact on Price and Investment Strategies\nHow to Find New Cryptocurrencies for Investment\nGlobal Cryptocurrency Regulations: A Guide to Key Countries\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do you get cryptocurrency?\nAny investor can purchase cryptocurrency from popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, apps such as Cash App, or through brokers. Another popular way to invest in cryptocurrencies is through financial derivatives, such as CME's Bitcoin futures, or through other instruments, such as Bitcoin trusts and Bitcoin ETFs.\nLearn More:\nCryptocurrency\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is the most well-known digital currency created in January 2009, after the concept was published in a white paper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large are touted to lower transaction fees when compared to traditional online payment methods, and unlike traditional government-issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority.\nLearn More:\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nWhat is Ethereum?\nEthereum is a blockchain-based crypto platform that is best known for its digital currency called Ether, or ETH. Ethereum is second in market value only to Bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap data. While the maximum number of bitcoins in circulation is limited at 21 million, the amount of Ether that can be created is unlimited, which is one of the main differences that investors should know.\nLearn More:\nWhat is Ethereum?\nHow do I buy Ethereum\nOne of the first steps to buying cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Bitcoin is to identify a platform for trading the digital currencies. Some of the top platforms including Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Gemini, Binance, and Bitfinex, which all offer Ethereum to buy and sell. Ether is also backed by many Fortune 500 companies, spurring investor interest.\nLearn More:\nHow do I buy Ethereum\nWhat is an ICO?\nInvestors looking to add new cryptocurrencies to their portfolios often look for an\ninitial coin offering\n(ICO), the crypto variation on an initial public offering (IPO). Like an IPO, a company seeking to raise money can create a new coin or service to launch an ICO as a way to raise funds. Investors in turn can buy the initial coin offering to own the new token, but should be aware of potential fraud within the industry, which is monitored by the SEC for potential abuse.\nLearn More:\nWhat is an ICO?\nInvestopedia / Alison Czinkota\nKey Terms\nCryptocurrency ETF\nBlockchain\nBitcoin mining\nDigital currency\nAltcoins\nHot wallet\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\nVirtual currency\nCryptocurrency ETF\nA cryptocurrency exchange traded fund is an ETF that tracks a single cryptocurrency or a basket of different digital currencies, and has similar benefits to a traditional ETF\u2014including lower cost of ownership and greater diversification. The first cryptocurrency ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, started trading in October 2021.\nLearn More\nBlockchain\nA blockchain is a distributed database that is shared and verified via a computer network. That database makes up the underlying infrastructure of cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, for a decentralized record of transactions.\nLearn More\nBitcoin mining\nBitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin by using computers with specialized chips to solve complicated mathematical puzzles. The first so-called miner to solve the puzzle can earn bitcoin rewards by running such programs using systems that use massive amounts of electricity to mine the cryptocurrencies\u2014a process that has come under criticism because the mining process is not considered environmentally friendly.\nLearn More\nDigital currency\nDigital currency is a form of currency that is also popularly known as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash, because they only exist in electronic form, versus a physical form such as paper cash or metal coins.\nLearn More\nAltcoins\nAltcoins generally speaking are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. They share characteristics with Bitcoin but are also different in terms of how they are created and verified. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin and Ether alone accounted for nearly two thirds of the total cryptocurrency market, with altcoins making up the rest.\nLearn More\nHot wallet\nA hot wallet is a cryptocurrency storage application that is always connected to your computer and cryptocurrency network, and as such they tend to be more vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches and theft than so-called cold storage methods. Hot wallets are used to send and receive cryptocurrency, and manage tokens you possess. Hot wallets are linked with public and private keys that serve as security measures.\nLearn More\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\nDecentralized finance, also known as DeFi, uses new technology to remove third parties such as banks and other traditional financial institutions in financial transactions. By removing centralized control by banks and other institutions over money, financial products, and financial services, the new financial applications may lower related maintenance costs and fees charged by banks\u2014and also increase the speed of such services.\nLearn More\nVirtual currency\nA virtual currency is a digital representation of value only available in electronic form, and is also known as\ndigital currency\n. Such cryptocurrencies can be issued by private organizations or companies and its benefits over hard currencies include fast transaction speeds and ease of use.\nLearn More\nHow Can I Give a Wrapped Bitcoin as a Christmas?\nPeople in This State Are Receiving $12,000 in Crypto as Part of a New Program\nInvesting in Crypto Made Easy\nHold or Flip?

Having written, expanded, and regularly updated our financial terms dictionary over the last 20 years, it would not be accurate to only credit the work of a single author or editor on most definitions. In some cases, as many as 20 different writers, editors, fact checkers, copy editors, editorial advisors, and financial experts have made significant contributions and changes to each definition over the years. All those changes are intended to bring you the most accurate information possible.\nIn the future, we plan to showcase the history of each term's evolution and all of those expert writers and editors who have contributed to it.

Investors who value low cost but need access to high-quality amenities and resources won\u2019t find a better exchange that consistently offers both. With a minimum deposit of just $10, Prospective clients can set up an account and start trading their favorite cryptocurrency.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nLow fees for beginning and advanced cryptocurrency traders\nA good selection of educational resources and research amenities\nAccess to web, desktop, mobile, and Kraken Pro platform\nCons\nKraken is not available in all 50 U.S. states\nDoes not offer FDIC or SIPC insurance or other criminal insurance.\nDoes not allow options trading for cryptocurrency\nOverview\nKraken was founded in 2011. While the company has gone fully remote, its head office is in San Francisco, CA.\nAside from its digital presence, Kraken operates worldwide in over 190 countries, services over 15 million clients, and has established itself as one of the premier cryptocurrency exchanges that offer the best low-fee service.\nKraken offers two platforms: a basic and a pro version. Clients utilizing the basic version can expect to pay the following fees: a fixed 1% trading fee, payment fees, and a spread. Regarding Kraken Pro, clients will pay maker fees between 0.00% and 0.25% and taker fees between 0.08% and 0.40%. The fee will be dependent upon the users' 30-day trading volume. Other fees, such as deposit and address setup fees, come at no extra cost.\nIn addition to its low-fee structure, Kraken offers a unique service that caters to multiple types of clients at various skill levels.\nFor instance, Kraken\u2019s regular platform enables beginning and low-volume traders to start trading and storing their cryptocurrency with a $10 minimum deposit, access to over 540 cryptocurrency assets, an excellent selection of educational and news content, and the ability to create and utilize Kraken's exclusive wallet.\nAdvanced traders who need more sophisticated features should consider Kraken Pro. This platform is designed for traders who need access to advanced order types, charting, and screening capabilities not offered on the original platform.\nThe Kraken Pro's best feature is that it\u2019s free to use. However, Kraken comes with potential drawbacks. While Kraken operates in many countries, the exchange is not available in all 50 U.S. states, such as Washington, New York, and Maine. Furthermore, in many other states, additional restrictions apply to activities such as staking, payment services, funding, and custody. Prospective clients interested in a specific service should check if it is legal in their respective state.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Kraken does not offer any insurance for its users.\nRead the\nfull Kraken review\nBest For Security\n,\nBest for Experienced Traders\n:\nGemini\nGemini\nMinimum deposit:\n$0.00\nMaker fees:\n0.00% to 0.20%\nTaker fees:\n0.03% to 0.40%\nAvailable cryptocurrencies:\n70+\nOpen Account\n(opens in a new tab)\nWhy We Chose It\nBest For Security\nGemini is our top choice for security. The crypto exchange has sound security standards, a commitment to compliance, and third-party audits that ensure its security infrastructure operates at a high level.\nIt\u2019s also one of the few crypto exchanges to offer FDIC and crypto insurance to help further safeguard traders\u2019 accounts.\nBest for Experienced Traders\nIn addition to being our choice for security, Gemini is also our top choice for experienced traders due to its ActiveTrader software. The platform offers experienced users the ability to conduct advanced charting techniques, use advanced\norder types\n, and trade futures and perpetual contracts.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nHighly secure and compliant platform\nAvailable in all 50 U.S. states\nPass-through FDIC insurance for uninvested cash and crypto insurance\nCons\nOffers a low number of cryptocurrencies\nCustomer support only has a request form\nComplex fee structure\nOverview\nGemini was founded in 2014 and is currently headquartered in New York, N.Y.\nDue to its high security standards, Gemini is our choice for users who value security for their cryptocurrency holdings. By default, user accounts are equipped with two-factor authentication. However, Gemini also supports external hardware security keys, such as YubiKey, to secure accounts further.\nGemini holds most customer assets in offshore cold storage, and it works to facilitate easy transfers of assets between the exchange and consumer wallets. Gemini also subjects itself to routine third-party audits and affirms that it has completed SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type 2 exams and its ISO 27001 certification.\nUsers also have the option to store their cryptocurrency in either Gemini\u2019s hot wallet, which is insured, or its cold wallet.\nGemini is also our choice for experienced crypto traders. While high-net-worth individuals can enjoy its high-security standards, they can also appreciate the advanced software it offers with its trademarked tool, ActiveTrader. Even though it offers more than 70 cryptocurrencies, it's still considered a low amount for a major crypto exchange. However, Gemini\u2019s ActiveTrader deserves recognition as a highly advanced platform capable of reaching trade execution speeds of 65 microseconds. Experienced traders also have access to high-risk assets such as perpetual contracts and indices.\nActiveTrader also provides advanced charting and order types that further assist traders in their cryptocurrency ventures.\nGemini does have some drawbacks, most notably its fee structure, as it can be complex. For ActiveTrader, depending on your 30-day trade volume, maker fees can range from 0.00% to 0.20%, while taker fees can range from 0.03% to 0.40%.\nGemini's fee schedule for basic order types, such as instant and recurring orders, will cost clients a 1.49% transaction fee combined with a 1% convenience fee. Limit orders will cost a 1.49% transaction fee, but do not have a convenience fee.\nAdditionally, the type of order you use to execute a trade can affect the total cost. Other fees include a 2.50% fiat transfer fee for using PayPal and a $25 wire transfer fee for fiat withdrawals.\nCustomer support should also be noted, as traders must submit a form to deal with issues like account management and fraud.\nBest for Beginners\n:\nCoinbase\nCoinbase\nMinimum deposit:\n$0.00\nMaker fees:\n0.00% to 0.40%\nTaker fees:\n0.05% to 0.60%\nAvailable cryptocurrencies:\n300+\nOpen Account\n(opens in a new tab)\nOn with Coinbase\nWhy We Chose It\nCoinbase is best for beginners due to its sleek user interface, solid security infrastructure, and a reasonable fee structure that is easy to understand. While Coinbase offers an excellent service for investors new to crypto trading, the company also provides more advanced features, which are nonetheless vital for beginning crypto traders. With Coinbase's comprehensive educational resources, beginners can enhance their skills and utilize Coinbase\u2019s more\nadvanced trading tools\nwhen they are ready, without having to jump to another exchange that caters to more experienced traders.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nExcellent educational and research resources\nReasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency\nAvailable in 172 countries and offers access to web, desktop, and mobile platforms\nCons\nIt may not be a good fit for established traders\nDoes not offer margin or option trading and only provides future trading on select crypto\nMust chat or request a call when contacting customer service\nOverview\nCoinbase is headquartered in San Francisco and was founded in 2012.\nSince its inception as a cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase has become one of the premier leaders in the cryptocurrency space and has done the one thing many crypto exchanges fail to do: cater to beginner crypto investors.\nCryptocurrency is a complicated\nalternative investment\nthat requires careful study by traders. However, Coinbase\u2019s educational resources, which cover basic and advanced trading topics, can help clarify its complexity.\nIn addition, Coinbase offers two charting versions: a basic and an advanced version.\nThe basic version is a simple chart with essential data such as market cap, volume, and other metrics that beginning traders will find valuable.\nHowever, it does not provide any charting tools, which is why Coinbase also has an advanced version.\nThe advanced version offers charting features such as Fibonacci, drawing tools, and projections. Even with advanced trading software, Coinbase may not be a great fit even for experienced traders, as the exchange lacks options and margin trading and only offers futures trading on specific coins.\nInvestors who open an account with Coinbase will see that it has a reasonable fee structure. Its maker fee ranges between 0.00% to 0.40%, and its taker fees are 0.05% to 0.60%.\nAlso, users can trade more than 300 cryptocurrencies while being able to survey over 19,000 digital assets.\nWhile Coinbase provides web, desktop, and mobile platforms, its customer service could be better.\nUsers can contact a service rep through chat or request a call for further assistance.\nRead our full\nCoinbase review\n.\nImportant\nOn May 11, 2025, Coinbase received an email communication from a threat actor notifying the company that internal data and customer information, including names, contact details, partial SSNs, and transaction history, had been accessed after allegedly bribing non-U.S. contractors. The attacker demanded payment to keep the data private. Coinbase says no passwords or funds were compromised and has not paid the ransom.\nBest Mobile App\n,\nBest for Bitcoin\n:\nCrypto.com\nCrypto.com\nMinimum deposit:\n$20\nMaker fees:\n0.08% to 0.25%\nTaker fees:\n0.18% to 0.50%\nAvailable cryptocurrencies:\n400+\nOpen Account\n(opens in a new tab)\nWhy We Chose It\nBest Mobile App\nCrypto.com is our choice for the best mobile app provider due to its major focus on its mobile platform and all that that entails. Crypto traders can buy, sell, use, and trade crypto from the palms of their hands.\nBest for Bitcoin\nCrypto.com is also our choice for Bitcoin traders and investors due to its reasonable fee structure and excellent security infrastructure, which is important to many Bitcoin investors and users. In addition, Crypto.com provides crypto traders with Bitcoin options and futures.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nAllows Bitcoin options and futures\nReasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency\nExcellent mobile platform and debit card program\nCons\nAvailable in fewer than 100 countries\nOnly offers chat service for assistance\nCrypto.com only provides access to a hot wallet\nOverview\nCrypto.com, headquartered in the Central Region of Singapore, boasts an impressive customer base of over 150 million users in more than 100 countries, which isn\u2019t bad for a company that was founded in 2016.\nThe main reason why Crypto.com is so popular goes far beyond its marketing campaigns. It's one of the best crypto exchanges for mobile-first traders and Bitcoin holders.\nMobile users considering Crypto.com can expect a sleek and fully intuitive mobile platform that offers more than convenience. Mobile users have access to more than 400 cryptocurrencies. Depending on the eligible cryptocurrency, users can earn rewards through Crypto.com\u2019s Earn program and its Staking program.\nIn addition to buying, selling, and using cryptocurrency as well as trading derivatives, Crypto.com also provides its mobile users with sophisticated trading features, allowing them to automate their trades. Furthermore, Crypto.com includes access to its Visa debit card, a cryptocurrency-connected card enabling users to easily use their crypto to buy goods and services on the private market.\nAlong with its mobile capabilities, Crypto.com is also best for Bitcoin. The platform offers a wide array of trading, from derivatives to regular long-term investments. The company has a reasonable fee structure, which also applies to its mobile platform. However, depending on their 30-day trade volume, users can expect maker fees to be between 0.08% and 0.25% and taker fees to be between 0.18% and 0.50%. VIP users who hold a tiered amount of\nCronos (CRO)\ncan enjoy additional benefits, such as discounts on maker/taker fees and debit card rewards.\nBitcoin traders will also have access to Bitcoin options and futures, which is an important feature for traders and investors alike.\nBefore users sign up for an account, they should consider the downsides. For instance, Crypto.com is not readily available in many countries. Before committing to opening an account, you should check to see if Crypto.com legally operates in your geographical location. While Crypto.com has an excellent support center to help users resolve issues on their own, it only provides access to a live chat feature for further assistance.\nBest for Altcoins\n:\nBitMart\nSimply Recipes / Alison Bickel.\nBitMart\nMinimum deposit:\nNot publicly disclosed\nMaker fees:\nNot publicly disclosed\nTaker fees:\nNot publicly disclosed\nAvailable cryptocurrencies:\n1,700+\nOpen Account\n(opens in a new tab)\nWhy We Chose It\nBitmart, which offers over 1,700 cryptocurrencies, is our top choice as the best crypto exchange for\naltcoins\n. While the exchange lacks fundamental trading features, it's an excellent plateform to buy cryptocurrency that traders would not usually have to access on other exchanges.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nAccess to over 1,700 cryptocurrencies\nAllows social trading through its copy-trading feature\nBitMart Academy provides excellent educational resources\nCons\nDoes not display its security infrastructure\nIts fee structure is not publicly disclosed without an account\nOnly supports crypto deposits to fund account\nOverview\nBitMart, founded in 2017 and headquartered in New York, N.Y., is our top choice for altcoins due to its accessibility to over 1,700 tradable cryptocurrencies.\nWhile still offering access to the most important coins on the market, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, it provides other coins that may be difficult to find on other exchanges. It's important to note that cryptocurrency poses significant risks even with established digital coins. Smaller, less established coins pose even more risks, with liquidity and market manipulation being a serious concern for crypto holders.\nBitMart also offers its users an interesting way to trade cryptocurrency: copy trading. BitMart users can access statistics for its top traders and see metrics such as\nreturn on investment (ROI)\nfor cryptos they trade, along with their trading history and current trade positions. However, traders should remember that past success does not automatically lead to future gains and should proceed cautiously.\nWhile BitMart has advanced charting capabilities, it\u2019s only for futures trading.\nIn addition, BitMart does not offer some of the order types that certain competitors offer. To date, BitMart only provides two order types: market and limit orders.\nThrough BitMart Academy, the exchange offers excellent educational resources that cover various topics, from basic knowledge to more complex subjects. While it provides a robust selection of crypto, there are some drawbacks. Its fee structure is not publicly disclosed withount an account. Prospective customers will need to create one before they can see BitMart's fee structure. In addition, the only way to fund a new account is to transfer crypto from a wallet or another exchange.\nBitMart claims to have an advanced risk control system with multi-signature technologies and a hybrid hot and cold wallet storage.\nUnlike some competitors, BitMart does not reveal its security infrastructure for users' accounts. For instance, it does not publicly state its security certifications or disclose whether it subjects itself to third-party audits. We can confirm that the company equips users with multifactor authentication.\nRead the full\nBitMart review\n.\nWhy You Should Trust Us\nInvestopedia launched in 1999, and since 2020, we have independently researched 14 cryptocurrency exchanges currently operating in the industry. To choose the best cryptocurrency, we analyzed nearly 450 key data points, including fees, available cryptocurrencies, trading features, security standards, and more, to bring together the list presented to you now.

The score for each company\u2019s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria in the following categories:\nTrading Features: 30%\nFees: 28%\nSecurity: 21%\nTransparency: 21%\nThrough our research, Investopedia has provided you with a list of the best crypto exchanges, guided by data-driven analysis and an unbiased and fair approach to helping readers find the best crypto exchange.\nRead our full detailed methodology\n.\nEverything You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency Exchanges\nInvestopedia / Julie Bang\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Investment and Coverage Explained\nBy\nBarry Higgins\nFull Bio\nBarry Higgins co-authored Building A Better Balance Between Your Business and Your Life and has 15+ years of experience in the insurance industry.\nLearn about our\neditorial policies\nUpdated January 08, 2026\nReviewed by\nEric Estevez\nReviewed by\nEric Estevez\nFull Bio\nEric's career includes extensive work in both public and corporate accounting with responsibilities such as preparing and reviewing federal, state, and local tax filings; supporting multinational teams on tax compliance and financial controls; managing bookkeeping, financial statements, and month-/year-end-close; and advising business owners on financial management and operational strategy.\nLearn about our\nFinancial Review Board\nClose\nKey Takeaways\nVariable life insurance combines permanent life coverage with an investment component, often involving mutual funds.\nThese policies offer death benefits and potential cash value growth, but carry more risk due to market fluctuations.\nTax advantages include tax-free growth of cash value accounts and the option for tax-free loans against the policy.\nEvaluating costs, coverage, and provider reputation is crucial before purchasing a policy.\nUnlike term life insurance, variable life lasts for the policyholder's lifetime, making long-term planning essential.\nWhat Is Variable Life Insurance?\nVariable life insurance is a permanent life insurance policy with an investment component. The policy has a cash-value account with money that is invested, typically in mutual funds.\nAs a permanent life insurance policy, variable life insurance pays a death benefit to your beneficiaries when you die. The coverage then lasts until your death, in contrast to a term policy, which has a set term. The cash value component of variable life insurance is invested in assets like mutual funds, so it may rise or fall in value.\nThese policies carry more risk compared to other life insurance policies. You can often allocate a portion of your premium to a fixed account, which guarantees a rate of return, to reduce overall risk. These policies also offer some tax advantages.\nWe'll explain their benefits and risks in detail so you can decide if a variable life policy is the right choice for your financial needs.\nHow Variable Life Insurance Works\nA variable life insurance policy works much like any life insurance policy in that you pay a premium and then your beneficiaries receive a benefit when you die. As a permanent policy, the coverage is in effect until your death.\nVariable life insurance also includes a cash value component that you can access for other purposes, such to pay for a major expense. The unique feature of variable life insurance is that its cash component can be invested in asset options, mainly mutual funds. The value of your account will depend on: the premiums you pay, how your investments perform, and the associated fees and expenses.\nYou can also allocate money toward a fixed account to receive a fixed rate of interest and reduce overall risk. This rate may change annually, but there is typically a guaranteed minimum, such as 3%.\nYour insurance company may require you to pay a specific amount of premiums, or it may give you the flexibility in paying premiums as long as you pay the required fees. Some providers may also offer protection against a lapse in coverage if you don't have enough cash value to cover policy fees.\nA variable life insurance policy can provide you with an opportunity to make money in the market that has tax advantages. The investment portion receives favorable tax treatment in that the growth isn't taxable as\nordinary income\n. So, you can draw from these accounts in later years, namely through loans using the account as\ncollateral\ninstead of making direct withdrawals, and receive tax-free income.\nImportant\nInsurance companies will provide a\nprospectus\ndetailing all policy charges, fees, and sub-account expenses.\nExample of Variable Life Insurance\nTo illustrate how variable life insurance works, say you purchase a variable life insurance policy with an initial premium payment of $200,000. You allocate half of that toward a stock fund, and half toward a bond fund. After a year, the stock fund has increased 7% in value and the bond fund has increased 3%.\nAs a result, your account would have $107,000 in the bond fund and $103,000 in the stock fund for a total of $110,000. (This is a simplified example, and in reality you would also have to subtract applicable fees.)\nFast Fact\nExamples of\u00a0life insurance companies that provide variable life insurance include Prudential and New York Life.\nBuying Variable Life Insurance: What You Need to Know\nBefore you buy variable life insurance, you'll want to consider a number of factors. First, review all the costs, including fees, and determine whether you can afford this type of policy.\nThen, if you do want to purchase this type of policy, determine how much coverage you'll need to meet your goals and how long you will likely need the insurance. Generally, investments with a longer time horizon can carry more risk than those with a short time horizon because they have more time to recoup any losses in the market.\nTip\nEnsure that the insurance company providing the policy is a reputable one, or one that is established and financially sound.\nIf you buy a variable life insurance policy, then change your mind, you have a short period of time called a \"look period\" in which you can cancel the policy with no charge and have your premiums returned. The length of the look period will vary by insurance company, but it is typically about 10 days. After that time, you will likely lose any premiums you've paid and may have to pay a cancellation fee.\nHow is variable life insurance different than term life?\nVariable life insurance is a permanent life insurance policy combined with a cash-value account invested in bonds or stocks. In contrast, term life insurance lasts for a specific number of years, a variable life insurance policy lasts until the policyholder's death.\nWhat are the tax benefits of variable life?\nGrowth of the cash value account isn't taxable like ordinary income. The accounts can be drawn upon in later years and may be received free of income taxation. To get tax benefits, you'll want to take out loans that use the account as collateral instead of taking direct withdrawals.\nWhat are the risks of variable life insurance?\nThe major risk of variable life insurance is that your investments can lose money. Unlike with other types of insurance policies, the insurance company does not guarantee a rate of return.\nThe Bottom Line\nA variable life insurance policy can help you meet your financial needs,\ninvestment objectives\n, and tax planning goals. However, these policies aren't necessarily right for everyone. You'll need to factor in both the potential risk and reward of investing in the market.\nConsider consulting a financial advisor who can guide you through options that can best suit your own financial situation and goals.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Investors can also use the platform\u2019s Round-Ups Multiplier, which will double, triple, or multiply by 10 the amount of the round-up.\nNote that if an investor only invests using the round-up tool, it can take a very long time to build a meaningful investment portfolio. In addition, because the rounded-up investment contributions are pulled from the user\u2019s checking account, it\u2019s important to monitor that account closely to avoid\noverdraft fees\n.\nBest for Mobile\n:\nE*TRADE Core Portfolios\nInvestopedia's Rating\n4.1\nout of 5 stars\nAccount Minimum:\n$500\nFee:\n0.30%\nLearn More\n(opens in a new tab)\nWhy We Chose It\nE*TRADE Core Portfolios\nwas acquired by Morgan Stanley, and offers a robo-advisor with a user-friendly mobile app, making it easy to access the platform\u2019s tools on the go.\nPros & Cons\nPros\nMultiple investment strategies, including core, ESG, and smart beta\nMobile app enables account opening and transfers, resembling the desktop\nAccess to the broad Morgan Stanley lineup of investment and financial management services\nCons\nMore expensive than competitive robo-advisors at lower cost\nNo live chat\nRelatively limited goal setting in the portfolio creation process\nOverview\nE*TRADE was founded in 1982 and acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020.\nIt offers a wide range of investment services, beginning with a questionnaire to assess an investor\u2019s goals,\nliquidity\nneeds, time horizon, and risk tolerance.

To create this list, Investopedia collected 2420 data points from 20 robo-advisor companies, focusing on the factors that are most important to investors. We reviewed each robo-advisor platform for fees, portfolio management services, goal-planning tools, and other key features in order to give each a rating. Investopedia has been helping readers find the best tools and platforms for managing their finances since 1999.\nHow Do Robo-Advisors Work?\nRobo-Advisors\nprovide automated investment planning\nbased on specific algorithms. They simplify the management of an investor's portfolio based on the type of account you have and your investment goals. One of the first things you'll do when establishing an account is provide answers to key questions about your financial goals. Depending on\nwhich robo-advisor\nyou choose, options for investing include stocks, bonds, and more.\nMost robo-advisors use a\npassive investing\napproach, which can involve basing one's portfolio on an index such as the\nS&P 500\nin order to match the performance of the index. More active approaches and more customization sometimes are possible, but those services typically will cost more.\nWho Are Robo-Advisors Best For?\nThose who don't have the time or the confidence to take a close, hands-on approach with their investment portfolios might be a good match for a robo-advisor. Because such a service is automated, one of the benefits is the amount of time it can save account holders. Robo-advisors also might be a good option for those who are new to investing because they provide a way to get started in investing while still learning the best approach.\nRobo-advisors\ncan also be a good fit\nfor those who want the convenience of 24/7 access to their accounts. Working with a traditional financial planner does not provide this kind of access.\nCommon Robo-Advisor Terms to Understand\nIf you are considering using a robo-advisor for your investing needs, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with these terms:\nModern portfolio theory:\nRobo-advisors often use an approach based on\nmodern portfolio theory\n, which is an approach designed to maximize returns within an acceptable level of risk. A key to this is a diversified portfolio.\nDiversification:\nHaving a\ndiversified\nportfolio involves spreading out your investment dollars among a broad range of stocks, bonds, and other assets. This is in contrast to having a large percentage of your investments committed to a single security.\nAsset allocation:\nOne way to describe\nasset allocation\nwould be that it is how an investor chooses to diversify assets, including equities, cash, and fixed income. The best approach to asset allocation depends on your needs and goals. Someone saving for the short-term would take a different approach than someone saving for the long term.\nRetirement planning:\nDetermining your approach to\nretirement planning\ninvolves knowing how much income you think you'll need in retirement, then creating and following a plan to get there. Some robo-advisors can help specifically with this common type of investment planning.\nIndex investing:\nRobo-advisors commonly use\nindex investing\nas a passive approach. This involves trying to create an investment portfolio that closely follows a specific\nmarket index\n.\nPros & Cons of Robo-Advisors\nPros\nEase of use\nLower costs\nInvestment models\nCons\nImpersonal\nLimited flexibility\nPros Explained\nEase of use:\nOne of the main draws of robo-advisors is that they are easy to use. It can be as simple as creating an account and answering questions about your investment goals. This ease of use also includes 24/7 access, which avoids having to fit someone else's schedule.\nLower costs:\nBecause robo-advisors take a passive approach, their costs typically are lower than those of working with a personal advisor or trying to actively manage your own investments.\nInvestment models:\nRobo-advisors offer choices of many investment models to follow. For example, if you want to focus on investing in environmentally conscious companies, there are robo-advisors that can handle that.\nCons Explained\nImpersonal:\nAn automated process built on algorithms is definitely easy to use, but for times when you might want specific advice or a certain kind of feedback, it's difficult to get exactly that with robo-advisors.\nLimited flexibility:\nWhile there are a lot of investment models to choose from, customization is limited or nonexistent depending on the robo-advisor.\nHow We Picked the Best Robo-Advisors\nProviding readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of digital wealth management companies, more commonly known as robo-advisors, is a top priority of Investopedia. We combined our industry research and subject matter expertise to guide the research and weightings for our 2026 robo-advisor rankings. To collect the data, our researchers gathered data points through online research of provider websites. To fill in any gaps, our research team reached out to the individual companies. In some instances, our researchers did much deeper online research to get the information they needed to complete the data collection. The data collection process spanned from April 5, 2025 to April 11, 2025.\nWe then developed a quantitative model that scored each company to rate its performance across nine major categories and 60 weighted criteria to find the best robo-advisors. The score for each company\u2019s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria:\nGoal Planning - 21.00%\nPortfolio Contents - 17.00%\nPortfolio Management - 17.00%\nFees - 15.00%\nAccount Services - 10.00%\nAccount Setup - 5.00%\nCustomer Service - 5.00%\nSecurity & Education - 5.00%\nUser Experience - 5.00%\nThrough this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top robo-advisors.\nThe above material and content should not be considered to be a recommendation.

Historically, admiralty courts were a separate part of the court system. In modern times, these cases may be assigned within the regular court system, usually at the federal or Superior Court level.\nIn the U.S., any court that is hearing a maritime case is an admiralty court for the duration of that case.\nUnderstanding the Admiralty Court\nAn admiralty court hears shipping, ocean, and sea legal cases. The definition of such cases is broad, encompassing contracts,\ntorts\n, injuries, and offenses relating to maritime law and events that occur on the high seas.\nKey Takeaways\nAn admiralty court hears a wide range of cases related to maritime law.\nIn the U.S., any federal court may be designated an admiralty court for the purposes of the case under consideration.\nCases heard in admiralty court are generally civil, not criminal.\nThe courts thus hear a range of cases covering\nshipping\n, boating, insurance matters related to ships or their cargo, collisions at sea, civil matters involving seamen, passengers, and cargo, salvage claims, claims for damages by ships, disputed ownership of ships, and even marine pollution cases.\nGenerally, modern admiralty courts hear civil actions, not criminal cases.\nAdmiralty courts have the power to issue a maritime lien against a ship, allowing the court or its appointees to seize the ship to settle claims against it.\nWhether it can be seized in other countries is governed by the admiralty courts of those countries and also is subject to any treaties that may be in effect among the nations involved.\nHistory of Admiralty Courts\nAdmiralty courts date back to the mid-14th century in England. At that time, they were under the jurisdiction of Navy admirals, hence the name.\nMuch later, regional Vice-Admiralty courts were established across the British Empire to resolve commercial disputes between merchants and seamen. During wartimes, their powers were expanded to deal with such matters as impounded enemy ships and criminal smuggling operations.\nIn the U.S., the founders envisaged from the start that federal courts would have jurisdiction over admiralty law since maritime matters often involved questions of national importance. This point is enshrined in the\nU.S. Constitution\n.\nImportant\nThe admiralty court has its origins in 14th century England. The judges were admirals.\nJurisdiction for matters that once fell under admiralty courts has been given over to regular court systems in most modern countries, usually at the federal or Superior Court level.\nIn Canada, the jurisdiction resides with the Federal Court. In the U.K. the Admiralty Court is now one part of the Business and Property Court under the High Court.\nTo this day, when such courts hear matters relating to admiralty law they will be referred to as admiralty courts. In the U.S., when federal courts act as admiralty courts, they operate under unique maritime law rules and do not impanel juries. The cases are heard by a judge.\nTake the Next Step to Invest\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\u00d7\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

Her writing has covered nearly every aspect of the financial world, from investing in forex to paying for college, and she specializes in presenting complex financial topics in an accessible way to non-experts.\nLearn about our\neditorial policies\nPublished January 11, 2026\nYou can boost your savings by downsizing now instead of in retirement, taking advantage of higher catch-up contributions in your 60s, and reallocating assets to prioritize growth.\nPatricio Nahuelhual / Getty Images\nClose\nKey Takeaways\nThe average 401(k) balance for people in their 60s was $568,040 as June 2025. The median amount saved was much lower, at $188,792.\nHow much you need to have saved for retirement will depend on your lifestyle and annual spending expectations. One rule of thumb is to save eight times your annual preretirement income by age 60.\nWhen you hit your 60s and retirement is right around the corner, you might find yourself thinking a lot about your 401(k). How does what you have saved compare to other people your age? And how much do you really need for retirement?\nWhile it can be\ntempting to compare your savings\nto your peers, how much you need to have saved will depend on when you plan to retire and what you want that retirement to look like.\n401(k) Savings in Your 60s: The Average and Median Balances Explained\nAccording to Empower, the average\n401(k)\nbalance for someone in their 60s was $568,040 as of June 2025.\nThis balance was slightly lower than the $607,055 average 401(k) balance for those in their 50s, presumably because some people in their 60s have already retired and begun taking distributions from their 401(k).\nKeep in mind that averages can be easily skewed: just a few 401(k)s with very high (or very low) balances can drastically impact the average. That's why the\nmedian\nor middle-of-the-road figure is important. The median amount in June 2025 was $188,792.\nRelated Stories\nRetirement Savings Secret Revealed: How One Overlooked Account Can Boost Your Nest Egg\nDon\u2019t Risk Retirement Funds to Pay Debt: Key Mistakes to Avoid\nHow Much Do You Need to Retire?\nIf you\u2019re looking at these numbers and worrying about\nhow your own retirement savings compare\n, you\u2019re not alone. According to a survey by Western & Southern Financial Group, 47% of\nBaby Boomers\n(who make up the majority of those in their 60s, as the oldest members of\nGeneration X\nturn 60 in 2025) are not confident in their ability to retire comfortably. Another 11% of Baby Boomers are unsure whether they'll be able to retire comfortably.\nThe same survey clearly identified why: Baby boomers believe they need an average of $760,000 saved to retire comfortably. Gen X expects to need even more: $1.18 million.\nAverage and median 401(k) savings for those in their 60s are far below these amounts.\nHowever, how much you need to retire depends on a variety of factors, particularly your lifestyle and your health. Rather than looking solely at averages, it\u2019s helpful to look at your personal situation to determine how much you need to save.\nOne retirement savings rule suggests having eight times your preretirement annual income saved by age 60.\nSo if you make $75,000 per year, you would need $600,000 saved by age 60.\nAnother calculation is based on\nthe 4% rule\n, which suggests that retirees withdraw 4% of their 401(k) in their first year of retirement, then adjust this for inflation in each following year.\nFollowing this rule would mean you need to have 25 times your annual expenses saved. So if you expect to spend $36,000 a year in retirement, you will need to have $900,000 saved.\nKeep in mind that most retirees don\u2019t live on their 401(k) alone. Most retirees in the United States receive Social Security benefits. You may also have investments, an individual retirement account (IRA), or even a side hustle that you plan to continue in retirement to supplement your 401(k) savings.\nThe Western & Southern survey found that 90% of Baby Boomers and 71% of Gen X expect to rely on Social Security as their primary retirement income, whereas only about half of Millennials and Gen Z (55% and 51%, respectively) do.\n5 Ways to Boost Retirement Savings\nIf you're in your 60s and your 401(k) isn\u2019t where you want it to be, here's how to boost your 401(k) savings in the last few years before you retire.\n1. Make Catch-Up Contributions\nIn 2025, the annual limit for 401(k) contributions for many people is $23,500. If you\u2019re in your early 60s, though, you can put away even more. If you are age 60 to 63, you can make additional\ncatch-up contributions\nof $11,250, for a total of $34,750. If you are age 64 or older, your catch-up contribution level is $7,500 for a total of $31,000 in 2025.\n2. Use Workplace Benefits\nAlexa Kane, a certified financial planner at Pearl Planning, recommends that anyone approaching retirement get as much as they can out of their workplace retirement benefits.\n\u201cIf your employer offers\na match on retirement contributions\n, contribute enough to get the full match,\u201d she said, even if you\u2019ve never maxed out your employer match before.\nKane also suggested automating savings to take the guesswork out of retirement contributions.\n\u201cMany retirement plans can be set up to automatically increase contributions by a percentage annually,\u201d she said.\n3. Reallocate Assets\nIn general, investors tend to hold more stocks in their 401(k)s when they are younger, taking on more risk in exchange for more growth. It\u2019s common to gradually shift to a more conservative balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets as you near retirement. If your 401(k) is invested in a\ntarget-date fund\n, then this shift happens automatically.\nIf you\u2019re in your 60s but feel like you aren\u2019t on track with your savings, don\u2019t immediately shift everything to conservative assets. Prioritizing growth for a few more years may help your 401(k) increase significantly in this decade. As you get closer to retirement, a gradual shift toward bonds and away from stocks will help protect your assets.\nTip\nA financial planner can assess\nwhat asset allocation is best\nfor you and advise you on when that allocation needs to change.\n4. Consider Downsizing Now\nIf you are part of the 51% who plan to downsize in retirement,\nconsider downsizing\nyour living situation now instead.\nDownsizing before you retire can significantly decrease your living expenses by reducing costs such as:\nProperty taxes\nHome maintenance and repair\nHomeowners insurance\nUtility bills\nIf you are\nstrategic about where you move\n, you can even prioritize things like access to public transportation, which can further reduce your living expenses by allowing you to drive less or own fewer cars.\nDecreasing your living expenses can allow you to put more into\ntax-advantaged\nretirement accounts now, giving the money time to grow. This can be especially helpful if you are trying to max out your catch-up contributions in your early 60s, when you can put even more into your 401(k)\npretax\n.\n5. Work With an Advisor\nWorking with a financial advisor as you approach retirement can help you figure out not just how much money to save, but also what kind of retirement you want and how you can make that happen.\n\u201cThere are many pictures of retirement,\u201d Kane said. \u201cAnd with any retirement plan, we say, \u2018You can do anything, but not everything.\u2019 There are pros and cons for every decision.\u201d\nWorking with an advisor can help you think through your options and what tradeoffs you might have to make for certain choices. For example,\nmany retirees like the idea of living abroad\nto get access to a lower cost of living, including cheaper healthcare. But the choice isn\u2019t just between a more expensive life in one country and a more affordable life in another.\n\u201cA large international move requires careful planning and an understanding of associated laws and regulations,\u201d Kane said. \u201cYou are still required to file U.S. taxes while living abroad. You also need to understand the\nForeign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)\nand the\nForeign Tax Credit (FTC)\n.\u201d\nA financial advisor can walk you through all these considerations and help you decide what kind of retirement makes sense based on your resources and priorities.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Interest is reported on Form 1099 to bank customers, typically in January each year for the previous tax year.\nLearn More:\nHow Is a Savings Account Taxed?\nHow do savings accounts differ from a Roth IRA?\nBoth savings accounts and Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars by individual investors. However, unlike savings accounts, any capital appreciation earned with a Roth IRA is not subject to federal income tax. Growth in savings accounts, in the form of interest, is subject to taxation.\nLearn More:\nSavings Account vs. Roth IRA: What\u2019s the Difference?\nHow is interest calculated on a savings account?\nSimple interest for a savings account is calculated by multiplying the account balance by the stated interest rate and then multiplying by the time period the money is in the account. Interest = Principal amount X Interest Rate X Time Period.\nLearn More:\nHow Interest Rates Work on Savings Accounts\nHow is a savings account different from a checking account?\nA savings account is different from a checking account in that it is meant for accumulation of funds and earning interest rather than being a transaction account accessible with checks and debit cards. Savings accounts can be freely accessed by the account holder through deposits and withdrawals on demand and generally pay higher interest than checking accounts but are not designed for payment transactions.\nLearn More:\nThe Difference Between Term Deposit vs. Demand Deposit\nKey Terms\nSavings Account\nDeposit Interest Rate\nSweep Account\nPassbook Loan\nLinked Savings Account\nJoint Account\nSavings Account\nA savings account is a deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution that pays interest on the balance held in the account. Interest rates are typically modest but these accounts provide safety for emergency funds and savings needed for long-term needs.\nLearn More\nDeposit Interest Rate\nThe deposit interest rate is the rate paid by banks and other financial institutions to deposit account customers in exchange for the use of their deposits to make loans. Deposit accounts include passbook savings, high-yield savings accounts, and certificates of deposit accounts.\nLearn More\nSweep Account\nA sweep account is a specialized account that is often attached to a brokerage account to automatically transfer or sweep cash funds into a low-risk, higher interest-earning investment such as a money market fund at the close of each business day.\nLearn More\nPassbook Loan\nA passbook loan is a loan made to a savings account owner or depositor by the bank holding the funds. The savings account balances serve as collateral for the personal loan, which is also called a pledged asset loan.\nLearn More\nLinked Savings Account\nA linked savings account is a deposit account connected to another account such as a checking or brokerage account. Linked savings accounts are usually held by the same financial institution as the customer's other accounts, facilitating efficient and timely transfer of funds between accounts.\nLearn More\nJoint Account\nA joint account is a type of deposit account that is held by two or more people, often spouses. Joint accounts are generally checking or savings accounts where both parties can make account transactions like deposits and withdrawals individually.\nLearn More\nHow Much Does the Average American Really Have in Savings?

Investing is one of the key strategies to building long-term wealth and financial security.\nA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Investing\nInvesting: An Introduction\nUnderstanding Stock Fundamentals: Key Metrics and Analysis\nHow To Start Investing in Stocks in 2025 and Beyond\nLower Trading Costs: Prevent Fees From Eating Investment Profits\n4 Basic Things to Know About Bonds\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I start investing with $1000?\nYes, many\nbrokerages\nhave no minimum account size and will offer zero-commission trading, allowing you to begin investing with even very small amounts. In fact, now with many brokers offering fractional shares, you can invest in stocks even if their share price is over $1000.\nLearn More:\nHow to Invest $1,000\nHow do I invest in stocks?\nWhile there are many ways to invest in stocks, one of the easiest and best ways for beginning investors to do so is to open up a retirement account with a discount broker. These accounts have tax advantages when saving for retirement and many different brokers have ones that cost little or even nothing to have.\nLearn More:\nBest Investment Accounts for Young Investors\nHow can I invest with no money?\nWhile you can\u2019t invest with zero money, you can invest with very little. Many stock brokers offer accounts with no minimum balance and no trading commissions so almost any amount you add to your account can be used to invest.\nLearn More:\nHow to Invest When You're Broke\nWhy should I invest?\nYou should invest because investing allows your savings to go farther than they otherwise would. Simply holding your savings as cash means it will just sit and be slowly diluted by inflation, whereas even in the safest investments it will earn some money for you, building on itself.\nLearn More:\nWhy Should I Consider Investing?\nWhen should I start investing?\nAs soon as you can afford to. Because investment returns compound, that is, the money you earn from investing then earns money, the sooner you begin investing, the more time you give for this process to work.\nLearn More:\n5 Advantages of Investing in Your 20s\nWhat time does the stock market open and close?\nIn the U.S. stock markets major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are open from 9:30 .a.m to 4.p.m Eastern Time. However, this varies around the world depending on what exchange you\u2019re looking at and whether that day is a holiday.\nLearn More:\nStock Market Opening Times Around the World\nKey Terms\nBond\nBond Yield\nTechnical Analysis\nSector Breakdown\nShort-Term Investments\nInvestment Banker\nWall Street\nBond\nA bond is an investment representing part or all of a loan to a person, government, or other entity. Bonds are issued at a set par value, usually $1000 or $100, and their prices fluctuates based on interest rates and perceived credit-worthiness of the borrower.\nLearn More\nBond Yield\nA bond\u2019s yield is the investment return that an investor will gain from a bond, usually expressed as a percentage. This is the percent of the bond\u2019s price that each set interest payment will be. Yields go up as a bond\u2019s price goes down and vice versa because they are a percent of the bond\u2019s value, therefore the higher the bond\u2019s price, the lower a percentage of that value a set interest payment will be.\nLearn More\nTechnical Analysis\nTechnical analysis is a form of stock analysis that involves looking at the price movements of stocks over time in order to predict where they will go. It attempts to find patterns in stock movements based on statistical trends such as the moving average of a stock or its trading volume. This contrasts with fundamental analysis which looks at the financial values of the business that issued the stock and economic conditions affecting the market and that business in order to assess where a stock\u2019s price will go.\nLearn More\nSector Breakdown\nA sector breakdown is a way to look at a portfolio by organizing it by which sector of the economy each stock is in. This allows an investor to, depending on their investing strategy, avoid stocks from companies in sectors they don\u2019t believe to have strong prospects, focus on stocks from sectors they believe are in a good position for growth, or ensure their portfolio is diversified.\nLearn More\nShort-Term Investments\nShort term investments are investments that are designed to be held for a year or less or investments a company intends to sell within 12 months. They are also known as \u201cmarketable securities\u201d or \u201ctemporary investments,\u201d and can be easily sold for cash.\nLearn More\nInvestment Banker\nAn investment banker works for a bank that deals mostly with raising capital for large institutions such as governments and corporations. They also deal with corporate restructuring as well as corporate mergers & acquisition (M&A).\nLearn More\nWall Street\nWall Street is a street in New York City which, due to having been a historical center of the U.S. financial industry, is used as a term to refer to that industry as a whole. It is often contrasted to Main Street, which is used as a term to represent the broader economy outside the financial industry, especially small businesses.\nLearn More\nBoost Dividends Quickly With This Simple Strategy To Triple Your 3% Yield\nTop Advisor Shares How You Can Build Wealth for Your Kids Without Being an Expert\nWhy Investors Should Be Cautious: Confident Analysts Often Miss the Mark\nOne of The Short Sellers Who Predicted The 2008 Housing Crisis Now Looks to Be Betting Against AI\nVenezuela Investments: High-Risk, High-Reward\u2014Or Neither?\nExplore Investing\nAll\nInvesting Basics\nStocks\nPortfolio Management\nMarkets\nMore\nAlternative Investments\nBrokers\nCommodities\nSustainable Investing\nBonds\nGuide to Mutual Funds\nFinding a Financial Advisor\nETFs\nFundamental Analysis\nFinTech\nQuantitative Analysis\nLaws & Regulations\nInvesting in the UK\nInvestors Double Down on \u2018Run It Hot\u2019 Trade: Is Your Portfolio at Risk?\nHow to Find Overlooked Investment Ideas Using ChatGPT \u2014 Step by Step\nAs the $11 Trillion Industry Stalls, Experts Warn of Uncertain Future\nTop Economist Warns: Rising Inflation and Slowing Growth Are Investors' Worst Nightmare\nConcerned About Inflation?

Why a Resume of Experience Matters for Yacht Insurance\nDecember 23, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    In\nYacht Insurance\nWhen you are looking to insure pleasure use yachts, the process can sometimes feel complicated. However, one of the most critical factors insurance companies look at isn\u2019t just the boat itself\u2014it\u2019s you. Specifically, underwriters want to understand your history and overall experience as an owner.\nIn the world of yachting, experience is everything. This is especially true when you decide to purchase a vessel that is significantly different from ones you have owned before. For example, if your yacht owner\u2019s history consists of vessels under 60 feet and you are now buying a 75-foot vessel, this \u201cjump in length\u201d is significant. It might require hiring a full-time captain to navigate the yacht.\nPerhaps you are moving from twin-engine fishing boats to a sportfish with quads. This increase in power may cause concern for underwriters, potentially leading to a higher deductible or a \u201cNamed Operator Warranty\u201d on the\nyacht insurance policy\n.\nIn these scenarios, carriers often require a detailed resume of your experience, including any loss/claim history, before providing an insurance quote. But why is this such a significant factor? Let\u2019s dive in.\nRequest a Quote for Yacht Insurance\nUnderstanding the \u201cJump\u201d in Length and Power\nFor any yacht, the size and the power of its engines can significantly affect both its performance and the boating safety of its operation. The length overall of the yacht and the number of engines it has influence several important aspects.\n1. Safety and Stability\nA larger yacht usually requires advanced handling techniques because it is less maneuverable than a smaller boat. Similarly, multiple engines provide more power but introduce different handling characteristics, especially in rough waters.\n2. Performance Expectations\nLarger yachts with more powerful engines travel faster and cover greater distances. However, this comes with increased risk. A jump in length or power changes how the vessel behaves, and without proper experience, a yachter may struggle to control it within their navigation limits.\n3. Wear and Tear\nLarger yachts undergo greater stresses, which affect durability. Marine insurance providers need to understand this to evaluate risks accurately and adjust premiums or coverage options.\n4. Operational Complexity\nManaging a yacht\nwith increased length or multiple engines is far more complex than handling a smaller, single-engine yacht. The operation of additional engines requires a greater understanding of engine synchronization and fuel management, especially in an emergency.\nWhy Insurance Carriers Need a Resume of Experience Upfront\nProviding a boating resume isn\u2019t just paperwork; it\u2019s about securing the right insurance protection for your specific needs.\nComprehensive Risk Assessment\nA yacht\u2019s size and power are directly tied to the risks an insurer needs to account for. The larger and more powerful the yacht, the higher the potential for property damage or bodily injury in an accident. By providing a resume upfront, insurance carriers can assess the operator\u2019s experience with the yacht\u2019s specifications to determine if they can handle the associated risks. This proactive risk management approach enables a thorough evaluation from the outset.\nEnhanced Accuracy and Efficiency\nSubmitting a resume upfront ensures that all relevant details about the yacht owner\u2019s experience are available early in the process. This minimizes the risk of discrepancies and provides consistent information. It also streamlines the decision-making process regarding insurance solutions, leading to faster processing times and quicker application approval.\nHandling and Maintenance Knowledge\nHandling a larger yacht with multiple engines requires specific skills. Whether it\u2019s docking, navigating tight spots, or dealing with rough waters, these skills need to be built up over time. Insurance companies want to ensure that the yacht operator has experience with these nuances. A resume of experience that demonstrates a history of safe operation helps reassure insurers that the yacht is in capable hands.\nMoreover,\nregular maintenance of larger yachts\nis crucial. Insurance carriers want to know that the yacht owner is proactive about maintaining the yacht properly, as this significantly affects the risk of mechanical failure or accidents.\nCustomized Coverage\nWith larger yachts or those with more complex systems, a generic policy\u2014or relying on standard homeowners endorsements\u2014will not provide the necessary coverage. A resume of experience helps insurers craft a policy that offers the right\nyacht insurance coverage\n.\nWhen we look at your experience, we can better structure the policy to address:\nHull Coverage:\nProtection for physical damage to your vessel\nAgreed Value vs. Actual Cash Value:\nDetermining whether your policy covers the agreed value (the insured amount decided at the start) or the actual cash value (which factors in depreciation)\nLiability Coverage:\nEssential protection and indemnity (P&I) for third-party liabilities, including bodily injury and property damage\nMedical Payments:\nCoverage for necessary medical expenses for you or your passengers\nUninsured Boater:\nProtection if you are hit by someone who lacks proper coverage\nPersonal Property and Personal Effects:\nProtecting your belongings on board, separate from the vessel itself\nWreck Removal:\nCovering the cost to remove your vessel if it sinks or blocks a waterway\nJones Act:\nCoverage for crew members\nif you employ a captain or crew\nLay-up:\nDefining periods when the boat is out of commission, which can affect premiums\nUnderstanding these coverage options helps you answer the question, \u201cWhat kind of insurance do you need for a yacht?\u201d versus a smaller boat.\nRequest a Quote for Yacht Insurance\nYachtsman Education and Experience\nYachtsman education, certifications such as Merchant Marine, Captains License, USCG Auxiliary, or United States Power Squadron courses, and hands-on experience play a vital role in how an insurer assesses risk. Underwriters prefer operators with a proven track record. By detailing your certifications and boating courses, you can improve your chances of receiving comprehensive insurance solutions at the most competitive terms and premiums.\nDemonstrating a commitment to boating safety and continuous learning\u2014such as staying up to date on navigation limits and new technologies\u2014builds trust. This transparency can positively influence the terms of your policy, offering you greater peace of mind.\nBuilding Trust and Credibility\nProviding a resume upfront demonstrates transparency and a willingness to share comprehensive information. This builds trust with the underwriters and shows that the yacht owner is serious about the application process. It reassures insurance carriers that the owner is committed to safe and knowledgeable yachting practices, which can positively influence the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.\nAdditional Considerations for Yacht Owners\nThe Role of Technology in Modern Yachting\nModern yachts are equipped with advanced technology that can enhance safety and performance, but also add to the complexity of operation. A detailed resume of experience should highlight any training or experience the yacht owner has with these technologies. This can further reassure insurance carriers that the owner is well-prepared to handle the sophisticated systems onboard.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nLarger yachts and those with multiple engines can have a greater environmental impact. Responsible yacht ownership includes understanding and mitigating this impact. Demonstrating a commitment to environmental stewardship can be a positive factor when seeking insurance coverage.\nThe Importance of Continuous Learning\nThe world of yachting is constantly evolving. Continuous learning is essential for staying up to date and ensuring safe, responsible yacht operation. Including a history of continuous learning on your resume of experience can demonstrate to insurers that you are committed to maintaining and enhancing your skills over time.\nThe Role of Professional Networks\nBeing part of professional yachting networks or associations can provide yacht owners with valuable support and resources. These networks often offer access to training, industry news, and best practices. They can also provide a platform for sharing experiences and learning from other yacht owners. Mentioning your involvement in professional networks or associations on your resume can further bolster your credibility with insurance carriers.\nSecuring Your Investment and Peace of Mind\nA jump in size and/or number of engines in some instances can impact your insurability. Insurance carriers rely on a detailed resume of experience to assess whether the yacht is being operated by an insured or by a captain accustomed to navigating similar vessels. Additionally, the cost of ownership and maintenance of the yacht has become more complex and more expensive.\nWhether you are purchasing a new yacht with significant differences in size and engine capacity from your prior yachting experience, providing a comprehensive resume of your experience upfront is essential.\nEnsuring that your resume includes detailed information about your yachting history, education, certifications, and relevant occupational skills can significantly enhance your chances of obtaining the best possible boat insurance or\nyacht insurance coverage\n. This proactive approach not only protects your investment against partial losses or replacement costs but also contributes to a safer, more enjoyable yachting experience.\nThe resume of experience is not just a formality but a crucial document that reflects your capability and commitment as a yacht owner. It serves as a testament to your skills, knowledge, and dedication to safe yachting practices. By providing a detailed, comprehensive resume of your experience upfront, you can build confidence with insurance carriers, ensuring you receive the liability insurance and physical damage coverage you need to protect your valuable asset and enjoy the full benefits of yacht ownership.\nFAQs About Yacht Insurance\nWhat Factors Affect the Cost of Yacht Insurance?\nSeveral factors influence your premium, including the vessel\u2019s value, size, age, cruising area (navigation limits), your boating resume, and the deductible you choose.\nWhat is a Normal Deductible?\nA deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before insurance covers the rest. For yachts, this is typically a percentage of the insured value (often 1% to 2%). An increased Named Storm Deductible is also applicable to most yacht policies. Note that in the event of a total loss, the deductible application may vary based on your specific policy terms.\nDo I Need Yacht Insurance for International Waters?\nStandard boat insurance usually has specific territorial limits. If you plan to travel internationally, you must inform your broker to ensure your yacht insurance coverage extends to those regions.\nWhat Are the Exclusions from Yacht Insurance Policies?\nStandard exclusions include wear and tear, gradual deterioration, osmosis, and damage caused by lack of maintenance. Indemnity is generally intended for sudden, accidental losses, not for maintenance issues.\nReady to upgrade your vessel?

Some incidents happen often enough to give all boat owners reason to pause and wonder:\ndoes my boat have insurance\n?\nIf you\u2019re in the market to buy a boat, marine insurance is\none of the most important things to consider\nduring that process.\nWhile boat insurance isn\u2019t required in Florida, it\u2019s a sound strategy to purchase a policy. No one can predict what will happen out on the water, and even the most careful captain can encounter difficulties on the waterways. Marine insurance exists to bail out boat owners during what could otherwise be\na financial disaster or the loss of your boat\n.\nWhat\u2019s more, the coverage offers peace of mind. Every time you head out on the water, know that you\u2019re protected by the invisible but vital coverage of Florida boat insurance.\nWhy do I need boat insurance?\nAccidents happen.\nBoats collide. They sink. They hit docks, break their tethers during storms, experience a crushed t-top when the tree they\u2019re parked underneath drops a huge branch. The list is long, and a Florida marine insurance advisor will have plenty of stories to share that prove coverage is truly imperative.\nBoat collision insurance is a popular coverage option, because the reality of a craft crashing into yours (or the other way around) is a possible one. Stories about such instances are widespread. If you collide with another boat and your passengers or the other boat\u2019s passengers are injured, you could be sued. You could be taken to court for\nmedical expenses\nand more. The correct marine insurance coverage will mitigate the damage.\nHomeowners insurance isn\u2019t enough.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the water, you\u2019re going to need the\nspecialized coverage\nthat only a solid marine insurance policy provides. And before you worry about sticker shock, it\u2019s likely less expensive than you might think. Partner with a Florida marine insurance advisor who has access to A-rated markets and understands how to combine coverages into an entire package, and you can find comprehensive coverage without breaking the bank.\nWhat does boat insurance cover?\nAs with most insurance coverage options, you can make your boat policy an\na la carte\ncombo of what is important to you as a boat owner. You\u2019ll have different types of insurance to choose from. Partnering with a seasoned marine insurance advisor will take much of the work off your plate.\nDifferent types of boating insurance include:\nCollision\nWhen two crafts collide, the results can be disastrous. There can be a loss of life, a loss of property, or, at the very least, the need for repairs on the craft. Purchase boat collision insurance (hull and liability coverage) to safeguard yourself against these costs. And remember: It\u2019s not enough to say that you\u2019ll just be \u2018extra careful\u2019 out there on the water. A collision takes two captains to occur \u2013 and that other boat driver may not be as experienced or careful as you are. They also may not carry insurance, leaving the financial burden on you.\nComprehensive\nComprehensive insurance (included in hull coverage)on your boat includes vandalism and theft. When you leave that expensive navigation equipment or personal items on board you\u2019re leaving yourself open to possible theft. In fact, your entire boat could be taken or damaged through vandalism \u2013 intentional or natural. Comprehensive coverage provides the money needed to restore the boat to shipshape condition.\nLiability\nDon\u2019t skip this coverage; if you\u2019re found liable for loss of property or physical damage to another person, a claim against you for liability can be in the millions. This will even cover your defense costs if that becomes necessary.\nThe 10 Most Common Boat Insurance Claims\nWe\u2019ve compiled some common Florida boat insurance claims in order to show you how beneficial it continues to be for boat owners.\n1. Hurricanes\nFloridians live with the threat of these mega storms on a regular basis. Some common insurance claims having to do with hurricane damage include boats improperly secured on lifts and vessels that are damaged by storm debris.\u00a0 Most marine policies have an increased deductible for Named (or numbered) Storms.\n2. Windy Weather\nIt doesn\u2019t take the wrath of a hurricane to damage a boat by weather. Tornados can wreak havoc on a boat, and a windstorm strong enough to turn objects into projectiles can severely damage a boat.\n3. Sinking (as the result of a covered loss)\nRecovering a boat that has sunk underneath the water can be majorly expensive; that is, unless you carry boat insurance that covers this unfortunate event.\n4. Hitting Underwater Objects\nEven the best viewfinder doesn\u2019t always function perfectly. Hit an underwater object, and the damage to your hull may render your craft useless. What\u2019s more, that underwater object can result in the sinking of your boat.\n5. Fire and Explosion\nA fire or explosion can completely total your boat. Imagine not having insurance in this situation; you would have no recompense and would have to count your vessel as a complete loss.\n6. Collision With Another Boat\nThis is a very real possibility. It\u2019s so important to carry boat collision coverage (hull and liability coverage) for legal and financial purposes alike. An accident in which both boat owners carry insurance is going to be much less devastating on the pocketbook than one in which neither (or just one) has it. Remember: a court can order you to pay damages to another party, even if you cannot afford to do so. Cover yourself in case this does happen, and you safeguard not only your current bank account, but your future earnings as well.\n7. Grounding\nRunning a boat aground is unfortunately common; thanks to the ever-changing levels of tides, it\u2019s easy to misjudge or forget that certain parts of the waterways are not deep enough. Rescuing and repairing a boat that has run aground requires some specialized assistance \u2013 and that can be expensive if paying out-of-pocket.\n8. Equipment Theft\nEven the most careful captain (and your crew) can forget to remove equipment from a boat. If you regularly stow expensive items aboard, protect the collection by insuring it.\n9. Boat Theft\nShould your boat be stolen, Florida boat insurance can make the sting a little less severe. You\u2019ll be able to purchase a new vessel to continue your exploration of the Sunshine State waterways. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be left with a boat lift or trailer that stands empty until you can save enough money to purchase a new vessel.\n10. Lightning\nThis is covered by marine insurance when you purchase hull coverage.\u00a0 It\u2019s a huge risk factor for Florida boats and replacing your navigational equipment can be quite costly.\nContact W3 Insurance for a quote\nHopefully, this article inspires you to do the right thing for yourself and your passengers: purchase a marine insurance policy.

Red flags include:\nThe owner picking the captain for the charterer.\nPre-stocked fuel, drinks, or supplies.\nThe crew was paid by the boat owner.\nPassengers think they\u2019re just renting a boat with a crew.\nInsurance Differences\nBareboat Charter Insurance:\nThis needs to cover hull, liability, and passenger injury; stricter underwriting is required due to the liability shift.\nCrewed Charter Insurance:\nThis type of insurance covers the vessel, passengers, captain, and crew under commercial marine insurance policies.\nWhat Affects the Cost of Charter Boat Insurance?\nThe\ncost of charter boat insurance\ndepends on various factors. Understanding these elements can help charter operators evaluate policies effectively.\nBoat Value and Type:\nHigher-value vessels or specialized watercraft (e.g., fishing boats) may carry higher premiums.\nOperating Area:\nGeographic location impacts risk assessments.

From the marshy Everglades to the tarpon-rich waters near Boca Grande, it\u2019s a boater\u2019s paradise. Join the ranks of those discovering the restorative nature of boat life.\nHere is everything you need to know about owning a boat in Florida.\nBasic Boat Safety Tips\nThe number one most important element to consider when purchasing a boat in Florida is the boating prowess of the owner. That\u2019s right: before you consider engines, hulls, power poles, or any navigational equipment, be honest about your experience level and your commitment to the craft. Purchase a boat you are comfortable captaining. A vessel that is too large, or that demands more than your training level, may leave you sitting on the shore, uncertain. Research the different types of boats thoroughly and select one that you feel confident driving.\nHaving a high level of confidence regarding the craft you captain is the most basic of basic boat safety tips. The next \u2018must have\u2019 element for every boat owner is the\nboat safety kit\n, which should always remain aboard.\nJust as a Florida homeowner is advised to keep a hurricane preparedness kit just in case, so too must the Florida boat owner have a selection of items that help in the event of an accident or loss of power.\nCommon safety kit items\nFlashlight (and batteries)\n\u2013 Should your vessel break down in the nighttime hours, you\u2019ll be glad to have the illumination.\nEmergency radio\n\u2013 We\u2019ve all been in situations without a phone charger when we really need it. The emergency radio is there even if your cell phone isn\u2019t \u2013 a link between you and those on shore.\nMirror for signaling and whistle for alerting\n\u2013 Hold a mirror up to the sun, and you can deflect that sunlight far away. Even if your electronic equipment fails, that signal can be seen for miles. A whistle is a simple object that can help to alert others of your presence and need for help.\nProperly prepared first aid kit\n\u2013 There are many different types of first aid kits. Compile your own or purchase a kit specifically packed for Florida boaters. Inside, you\u2019ll find the usual bandages, ointments, etc. We recommend adding sunscreen to the mix (that Florida sun can be brutal, and if you\u2019re stranded, you\u2019ll be glad to have it).\nFire extinguisher and garbage bags\n\u2013 The need for the fire extinguisher is apparent, but garbage bags? \u2013 Yes, they are a worthy addition to the Florida boater safety kit. Use garbage bags as ponchos if it rains or to help conserve heat in cold weather.\nLife jackets\n\u2013 There needs to be one\nlife jacket\nfor every person aboard, regardless of age, even if they are expert swimmers. They should be approved by the U.S. Coast Guard.\nDuct tape, buckets, and ropes\n\u2013 Duct tape might not fix everything, but it can plug a small leak and give you enough time to get your craft back to shore. A simple bucket plays an important role if you need to bail out. And ropes are a must on any craft, at least to tie up to docks and rescue an overboard passenger.\nNow that you have the items necessary to make up a Florida boat safety kit, it\u2019s time to educate yourself regarding active, in-the-moment boat safety practices. Hopefully, if you follow the guidance of your boating safety class, you will never need the safety kit at all.\nRecommended Boating Safety Courses\nDid you know that you are\nrequired to take a boat safety course\n? If you are operating a motorized boat of more than 10 horsepower and were born during or after 1988, you are required to do so \u2013 an important part of keeping our waterways safe.\nLook for a course that is Florida-approved; different options exist, including online selections. We suggest this one from\nBoat Ed\n. You can also peruse the list curated by the\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\nfor a solid list of options.\nAfter you\u2019ve aced your Florida boating safety course, make sure you know what to do if your boat breaks down or is involved in an accident. Knowledge gives peace of mind\u2013that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled this boating accident and breakdown guide for a quick snapshot regarding what to do if your Florida boat runs into trouble.\nBoating Accident and Breakdown Guide\nShould a boating accident or breakdown occur, do an immediate check of everyone aboard for injury and to see what medical attention, if any, is needed. Break out the Florida boat first aid kit and tend to any wounds. Then, call for help using your cell phone or the emergency radio aboard.\nWhat to do when involved in a boating accident\nDocument\nthe moment as much as possible. In the frenzy of stress that always accompanies a boating accident, major details can be lost. Take pictures of any damage and, instead of writing things down, you can dictate what happened and save the recording in your phone.\nDetermine if the U.S. Coast Guard should be notified\n.\nCall your marine insurance agent\nand let them know what has happened. Hopefully, you\u2019ve opted for comprehensive insurance protection that has you, your passengers, and your beloved boat covered.\nWhat to do in the event of a breakdown\nTry to move your craft out of the way\n, if possible, if you are on a heavily-traveled waterway. This could save your boat from a collision.\nCall the nearest harbor master,\nor break out the emergency radio and call for help. Different tow services exist to help boaters who are stranded, or the Coast Guard may come to your aid if appropriate.\nWhere to store your boat\nIt\u2019s important to know what to do\non\nthe water, but how are you protecting your boat when you\u2019re\nnot\nexploring the Florida waterways? There are several options available to you.\nStoring your boat in Florida is quite easy. You could leave it outside your residence\u2013keeping the vessel nearby and avoiding marina fees There are some drawbacks to this commonsense approach, however.\nExposing your craft to the elements\nis a surefire way for it to deteriorate more quickly. A pervasive example of this is upholstery. Even the most watertight boat cushions are going to eventually disintegrate, and the more you expose a boat to the elements, the quicker this will occur. You could keep your boat in the garage, of course, but the vessel will take up most of that valuable storage and parking space.\nLift storage\nPerhaps you have a lift outside your home, ready for your boat to be perched and lowered. This is a solid Florida boat storage selection, but make sure that if a hurricane or tropical storm looms, you\u2019ve taken the necessary precautions to keep that on-site boat secured.\nMarina storage\nStorage at a marina is another viable way to keep your boat safe and at the ready for future voyages. Often, marinas will offer security details\u2013but you should still never keep expensive equipment aboard when storing your boat.\nFor those who don\u2019t live on the water, or who don\u2019t want to keep a boat on their property, a marina can be a wonderful choice. Before you select one, make sure to thoroughly understand their\nrules and regulations\n, especially how easy (or difficult) it will be to access your craft whenever you\u2019d like.\nDry stack storage\nIn dry stacking, boats are placed on racks, often indoors and away from the elements. To retrieve your boat, you\u2019ll need to call the storage facility ahead of time and have it lowered and prepared to move safely to your trailer via forklift. This storage option is attractive to those who boat rarely or don\u2019t reside in Florida permanently.\nBoatyard storage\nBoatyard storage is a hybrid Florida boat storage option that combines dry stack storage with near-marina storage. In this case, the stacked boats are kept outside but not necessarily on the water. This is less expensive than marina storage and keeps you relatively close to an embarkation point. You\u2019ll need to follow the same call-ahead process you\u2019d use when dry docking.\nNo matter which Florida boat storage mode you select, resist the impulse to keep the vessel in the water for an extended period of time. Salt water is highly corrosive to boats and, for those not in salt water, weather damage can be catastrophic. At the very least, lift the boat out of the water and remove any electronic equipment and valuables after every excursion.\nImportance of marine insurance\nFlorida marine insurance is so absolutely vital. When it comes to everything you need to know to own a boat in this beautiful state, understanding marine insurance ranks near the top of requirements for safe boating.\nMarine insurance is the ultimate protection for your vessel. Consider it a sort of \u2018invisible life jacket\u2019 you carry with you as you navigate the waterways. Before you ever load the fishing gear and cooler, stock the first aid kit, or chart that first Sunshine State boating excursion, you must protect yourself, your passengers, and your vessel from the unexpected. No one can predict the future\u2013but marine insurance can safeguard you against many unexpected troubles.\nThings to consider when purchasing Florida marine insurance\nInsurance cost\ndepends on the type of vessel, the surrounding environment, the contents aboard, and how you\u2019ll use the boat. You will want to consider physical damage coverage and liability while also considering optimal coverages available to you.\nCall an experienced advisor\nto compile a\npersonalized policy\n, as it is easy to miss a vital part of insurance protection. A marine insurance advisor considers multiple elements before ever suggesting a policy.\nIf an accident were to occur\n, would your passengers\u2019 medical care be covered? Who is liable for those injury-related costs? Your marine insurance advisor can help answer these questions and propose solutions.\nPrepare for the worst and hope for the best.\nThat\u2019s what Florida marine insurance is there for\u2013 to protect you and your craft in a worst-case scenario, while allowing you to go on every voyage with the calm that comes from that protection.\nStay Protected with W3 Insurance\nFlorida marine insurance is the ultimate life jacket.

A Guide for Yacht Owners\nThe Jones Act\n, formally known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, is one of the most critical pieces of legislation in U.S. maritime law. While you may have heard this term within shipping, boating, or insurance discussions, understanding its wide-reaching implications is essential, especially if you\u2019re a yacht owner or maritime professional with captain/crew exposures.\nBelow, we explore key aspects of the Jones Act to help you understand your obligations, protect your crew, and ensure compliance with this federal law.\nIf you\u2019re a\nyacht owner\nlooking to ensure comprehensive protection for your vessel and crew, we invite you to contact our marine insurance advisors. They can provide a\ntailored yacht insurance\nquote with crew coverage, ensuring you have the proper protection.\nWhat Is the Jones Act?\nThe Jones Act is a federal law designed to protect U.S.-flagged vessels, their operators, and their crews. It governs coastwise trade and establishes specific requirements for ships operating between U.S. ports or conducting domestic trade. It was enacted by the U.S. Congress to stimulate the shipping industry in the wake of World War I.\nHere are some basic principles of the law:\nU.S.-built ships must transport goods or passengers between U.S. ports.\nCompanies operating under the Jones Act must employ U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\nThe Act prioritizes the interests of the American Merchant Marine and national security in a global shipping industry.\nFor yacht owners, one of the most critical aspects of the Jones Act is its focus on safety and working conditions for maritime workers. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how this legislation can impact your responsibilities as a yacht owner.\n1. Captain/Crew Protections\nThe Jones Act provides workers with necessary legal rights, including your yacht\u2019s captain and crew. If a crew member sustains injuries while working on your vessel, they have the right to file claims for compensation. These claims often include\ndamages for medical expenses\n, lost wages, and even pain and suffering.\nIf your captain or crew members feel unsupported, their dissatisfaction could escalate into legal claims. Protecting your crew isn\u2019t just about compliance\u2014it\u2019s about preserving harmony and professionalism aboard your vessel.\nKey Tip:\nMake sure your insurance policy provides comprehensive captain/crew coverage to meet these obligations.\n2. Liability and Negligence\nUnder the Jones Act, yacht owners can be held responsible for injuries caused by negligence or unsafe conditions on board. This means it\u2019s your responsibility to:\nEnsure proper safety measures are in place.\nConduct routine inspections for potential hazards.\nMaintain your vessel\u2019s overall seaworthiness.\nFailing to operate a safe and secure yacht puts your crew at risk and exposes you to expensive legal claims.\nInsurance Tip:\nMany yacht insurance policies offer liability protections to reduce financial risks from negligence claims. Speak to a marine insurance professional to ensure your yacht\u2019s policy includes this crucial coverage.\n3. Maintenance and Cure\nOne of the essential provisions of the Jones Act is the requirement to provide \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d for injured crew members.\nMaintenance\ncovers the crew member\u2019s daily living expenses while recovering.\nCure\npays for their medical treatment until they reach maximum medical improvement (MMI).\nThis obligation applies regardless of fault, so even if the crew member\u2019s injury wasn\u2019t caused by negligence, as a yacht owner, you\u2019re still responsible. Coverage for maintenance and cure claims helps ensure your yacht operation remains financially sustainable in the event of crew injuries.\n4. Obligation to Provide Captain/Crew Coverage\nProviding comprehensive insurance coverage for your captain and crew isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s a legal and moral obligation.\nThis coverage should include protection for:\nInjury due to negligence\nClaims about safety in the work environment\nClaims for lost wages, pain and suffering, or disability\nMaintenance and cure obligations\nThird-party passenger liability, if applicable\nBy ensuring proper insurance coverage, you safeguard your crew\u2019s well-being and protect your financial interests.\nProactive Measure:\nConsult an experienced marine insurance provider to create a policy tailored to your yacht\u2019s unique needs.\n5. Jones Act Requirements for Vessels\nWhile the Jones Act primarily applies to\ncommercial vessels\n, its focus on crew protections and overall safety extends to yacht owners with captain and crew exposures.\nAdditionally, the law emphasizes adherence to coastwise laws, such as hiring U.S. citizens or permanent residents as crew members. Special cases like transporting goods or docking in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, or along coastlines may invoke specific Jones Act rules.\nYacht owners must take these regulations seriously to avoid non-compliance.\n6. Seaworthiness Requirement\nThe Jones Act includes an implied warranty of seaworthiness, meaning that as a yacht owner, you are obligated to ensure that your vessel is reasonably fit for its intended use. This includes keeping the vessel safe for the captain/crew to work on.\nIf a captain/crew member is injured due to the vessel\u2019s unseaworthiness, they may have grounds to file a negligence claim for which the yacht owner would be liable. In some instances, a judgment could be placed against the vessel itself.\n7. Economic and Security Implications\nThe Jones Act is a central piece of legislation for protecting the rights and safety of U.S. maritime workers, including your yacht\u2019s captain/crew. The Act maintains a robust and regulated maritime workforce, thus supporting the domestic maritime industry overall. Ensuring compliance and understanding your responsibilities under the Jones Act helps you provide a safe and secure environment for your captain/crew while minimizing potential liabilities.\n8. Consequences of Not Providing Coverage\nFailing to meet your obligations as stipulated under the Jones Act can result in:\nCostly lawsuits from crew members seeking compensation.\nPersonal liability, with significant out-of-pocket expenses.\nConsequences that may financially jeopardize your vessel\u2019s operation.\nBy understanding your responsibilities and securing robust insurance coverage, you can avoid these penalties while fostering trust and security among your crew.\nSecure Your Vessel\u2019s Future\nInterested in learning more about how the Jones Act applies to your yacht?

Requests for waivers of specific provisions of the Act are reviewed by the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) on a case-by-case basis.\nWhy Is the Jones Act Controversial?\nCritics argue that the Act increases shipping costs by requiring goods to be transported on U.S.-owned and operated vessels, limiting competition from foreign ships in the U.S. economy. However, supporters view it as vital for protecting national security and the U.S. maritime industry.\nYou might also like\nUpgrading Your Vessel?

Keep your vessel shipshape by shielding it from the elements and you\u2019ll reap the longevity benefits that come with a well-maintained marine craft.\nUnless you store your vessel indoors in a hurricane-safe storage facility, it\u2019s often difficult to keep it completely safe from the elements.\nThere are different ways to achieve this aim, and it\u2019s helpful to consider each one before making your ultimate boat storage selection. Reduce wear and tear on your boat by selecting the option that\u2019s right for you.\nFirst, let\u2019s answer the obvious question: Why is it important to properly store your boat? In a perfect world, boats would be impervious to the effects of weather or corrosion. You could park your vessel in the driveway and never worry about a tree falling and damaging onboard contents; it would be just fine to tie up to a dock and keep that hull bobbing in the water indefinitely. This is a world where corrosion exists, unfortunately. The threat of potentially violent weather poses a threat as well. Therefore, it is important to have a plan for securing your boat accordingly. How you do that is up to you, but this guide can help you decide.\nSo what are your boat storage Florida options? You can store the boat either in-the-water or out, covered or wide open. But there are more options than you might think. What really wins the blue ribbon for \u2018the best boat storage option\u2019 depends on the type of boat and the storage options that are actually nearby.\nThe answer that is right for one Florida boat owner is different from the answer for another. Here are some highlights of different boat storage modes and different boat storage ideas to consider.\nTypes of boat storage\nIn-water storage\nCaution: extra care necessary.\nLet\u2019s start with the easiest storage option available to everyone: in-the-water storage. If you do not care how long your vessel stays pristine, this is a great option. We suggest that you don\u2019t store your boat this way for any length of time. Your boat will be\nfully exposed\nto water, which can wear away at that shiny gel coat. Should a storm occur, the vessel could also break free of its mooring and float into another person\u2019s backyard waterway. If you absolutely have to leave your boat bobbing in the water, take care to\nsecure it extremely well\nwith lines. Hopefully, you have a plan to take it out and secure a different means of storage as soon as possible.\nAt-home storage\nUnless you plan to\nuse your garage for boat storage only\n, this will not work well. Trailering the boat and keeping it on the side of the house may be an option; if you choose to do that, make sure to take all items off the boat every time you park it and have a secure cover.\nLift storage\nFor those boat owners who use boat lifts, this is a viable means of boat storage. One of the benefits of lift storage is that the boat will be\neasy to launch\n; this may mean that you and your family will use it more often than you might if the vessel were at an offsite location. It takes mere seconds to lower a boat from its lofty lift perch and into the water. Within a minute or two, you and your family are then off on the next watery excursion.\nKeep in mind that when storing your boat on a lift, you must take care to\nproperly secure it in the event of inclement weather\n. A boat that is overrun by storm surge may break free of its tether. The Internet is full of shocking pictures of boats tipped half-in, half-out of the water or nudged into neighboring backyards by strong currents, wind, & tidal surge.\nPlatform lifts and profile lifts\nare two options, and as for cost, a good rule is to expect to pay approximately $1 for every pound that the lift will have to hoist. For the sake of preparedness, this is definitely a time to overestimate your costs.\nOutdoor boatyard\nAn outdoor boatyard is another option. It\u2019s essentially a car lot filled with boats. Covers can be used to offer further protection. Some boatyards are adjacent to marinas, but it will likely cost less to keep your vessel in the nearby boatyard than in the marina itself.\nMarina slips\nMarinas offer a few options for storing your boat. One option is the\nwet slip\n, in which a vessel will securely float in the water. Often, this storage area is covered and offers fair protection from the elements. Still, this is a version of that in-water storage that can lead to corrosion of the paint and other wear-and-tear.\nAnother option is a\nlift slip\n, which is just what it sounds like. The boat is lifted out of the water, which helps prevent the erosion it can suffer in the water.\nHowever, not every marina covers its lifts, meaning that the elements can affect the vessel. This can cause major problems if a storm hits and the boat is not properly secured.\nHigh-and-dry storage\nThis indoor option keeps your vessel out of the sun and surf. This is ideal for those who\ndo not plan to use the boat on a regular basis\n. It is necessary to call ahead and have someone remove your vessel from its perch before you can trailer it to the next destination. This adds another step to the preparation you must do before taking the boat out on the water, so consider whether high-and-dry storage is too much of a hassle.\nStorage costs\nThe cost to store a boat\nwill vary widely\nbased on the type of storage and the location of the facility. The cheapest mode of storage is obviously at-home storage. The most expensive will likely be at a marina, where you often reap the benefits of on-site security along with a convenient way to launch.\nNo matter which way you choose to store a boat, it is\nimportant to properly insure it\n. Though Florida does not require marine insurance for boat owners, electing not to purchase a policy is a huge risk. Many destruction scenarios can happen that involve a vessel, and accidents and property loss are only two. The best course of action is to\nselect a marine insurance advisor\nyou trust to build a personalized policy plan for you.\nExplore the water with confidence\nW3 Insurance protects vessels so that their owners can feel confident exploring the waterways. Boating is such a joy; protect yourself for the unexpected by trusting W3 Insurance with your boat insurance requirements.\nSpeak with an experienced W3 marine insurance advisor and\nrequest a quote today\n.\nYou might also like\nUpgrading Your Vessel?

The powerful winds, heavy rain, and storm surges associated with these weather phenomena can cause devastating damage. If you own a yacht in\nhurricane-prone regions\n, it\u2019s crucial to be proactive and well-prepared to minimize the risk of damage and ensure the safety of both the vessel and its crew.\nThis guide will walk you through essential hurricane preparedness steps, address frequently asked questions, and help boaters understand insurance policies and coverage specifics.\nWhat Is a Hurricane Plan for a Yacht?\nA hurricane plan for a yacht involves detailed preparation to minimize damage during storms. It includes securing your vessel, choosing a safe location, maintaining emergency equipment, and understanding your responsibilities as outlined in your insurance policy.\n1. Know the Hurricane Forecast and Stay Informed\nBefore you start preparing your yacht, stay up-to-date with weather reports and hurricane forecasts. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) and local meteorological agencies provide accurate and timely information regarding hurricanes. The sooner you know a storm is approaching, the more time you\u2019ll have to take the necessary precautions.\nTrack the Storm:\nFollow the storm\u2019s path, intensity, and projected landfall to determine the potential impact on your location. Websites like NOAA and apps like Storm Radar give real-time updates on storm paths, intensities, projected landfalls, and storm surge risks.\nActivate Alerts:\nSet up notifications and alerts on weather apps, TV, or radio to receive real-time updates.\n2. Secure Your Yacht\u2019s Docking Location\nIf your yacht is docked in a marina or at a dock,\nensuring the docking area is prepared\nfor the incoming storm is critical. Here\u2019s how you can do that.\nDouble Check Lines and Fenders:\nEnsure that your yacht\u2019s lines are secure and of adequate strength. Use heavy-duty dock lines, spring lines, and fender boards. Additional extra fenders provide an extra layer of protection. Ensure your lines are long enough to handle rising water or a tropical storm.\nPrepare for Chafing:\nProtect your ropes from wear by adding chafing gear at contact points such as pilings and cleats. These prevent rope breakage during high winds.\nRemove or Reinforce Sails:\nIf your yacht has sails, remove them or secure them tightly to avoid damage. This will prevent the wind from catching the sails and causing damage to the mast or rigging. The same goes for dinghies, bridge enclosures, and cockpit coverings.\nTie Down Everything That Can\u2019t Move:\nTillers, wheels, outboard motors, ladders, grills, and booms should all be secure.\nCheck for Docking Adequacy:\nSome marinas may be susceptible to storm surges or flooding. If you suspect that your current marina won\u2019t withstand the storm, consider relocating your yacht to a safer location or choosing a dock further inland.\n3. Prepare Your Yacht\u2019s Safety Systems\nEnsuring your\nyacht is prepared for the storm\ninvolves checking its equipment and systems to ensure they are reliable.\nStorm Anchors:\nIf your yacht is anchored offshore, use a reliable and robust storm anchor. Ensure it is the correct size and weight for your vessel. Double-check your anchor lines and ensure they are long enough to provide ample room for your yacht to swing and avoid collisions.\nCheck Bilge Pumps and Batteries:\nTest your bilge pumps to ensure they are functioning correctly and can handle excess water in the event of a flood on your yacht. Also, check the batteries to ensure they are fully charged and can power critical systems, such as the bilge pump, lights, and communications, in case of power loss.\nSecure Your Electronics:\nProtect sensitive electronic devices, such as GPS, radar, and radios, by storing them in waterproof containers. This will prevent water from damaging these vital components. Alternatively, remove loose items like these to prevent damage.\nStock Emergency Supplies:\nKeep your yacht well-stocked with emergency supplies, including life jackets, flares, flashlights, first aid kits, spare hoses, extra food and water, and any necessary medications.\n4. Minimize the Risk of Flooding\nFlooding is one of the most damaging aspects of hurricanes, so preventing water from entering your yacht is a top priority. Here\u2019s our advice.\nCheck Hull for Leaks:\nInspect the hull and deck for any existing leaks or damage. Seal any gaps or cracks using marine-grade sealants to prevent water from seeping in. Ensure the drain plug is secure and adjusted properly.\nSecure Hatches and Ports:\nLock down hatches, ports, and Bimini covers to prevent water from entering.\nProtect Below Decks:\nIf possible, move any valuables or equipment stored below deck to higher levels. The bilge area should be clear to allow water to drain efficiently if needed.\n5. Consider Moving Your Yacht\nIf the mooring location is vulnerable or prone to surges and flooding, consider moving your yacht to safer inland marinas or a boatyard. Here are some other options to consider.\nHaul Out Your Yacht:\nIf possible, use a boat lift or jack stands to transfer your yacht to land. This is one of the most effective ways to protect your vessel from storm surges, winds, and flooding. Dry storage or shipyards are ideal choices for severe storms. However, not all marinas have facilities for hauling out yachts, so plan ahead. Once you\u2019re in a safe place, use wheel chocks or blocks to prevent the boat from rolling.\nMove to a Protected Harbor:\nIf hauling out is not feasible, try to move your yacht to a more sheltered harbor or a location that\u2019s less likely to experience storm surges or high winds.\u00a0 Relocate to protective bays or coves for mooring away from hurricane paths. Use additional anchors to stabilize the yacht against high winds.\nAnchor Offshore:\nIf moving your yacht to another dock isn\u2019t an option, consider anchoring your boat in a location that is safe from the storm\u2019s predicted path and protected from rough waters. Double-check that the anchor can handle severe low tide or shifting currents.\n6. Ensure You Have the Right Insurance Coverage\nA clear understanding of your\nmarine insurance\nensures that you\u2019re fully prepared for hurricane-related claims.\nReview Your Boat Insurance Policy:\nInspect policy limits on your declaration page, policy terms and conditions, coverages, exclusions, and endorsements. Go over your policy\u2019s details, including:\nCoverage limits for storm surges and physical damage\nIncreased hurricane deductibles for named storms\nRequired steps as part of your hurricane plan\nSalvage clauses and liabilities for damages\nNamed Storm Deductible May Apply:\nCheck if your policy has an increased hull (physical damage) deductible for hurricane damage. Many insurers will have a higher deductible for named/numbered storms.\nSalvage Charges:\nWhen a covered loss occurs and hull coverage is in place, generally, the salvage charge (if applicable) is covered under the hull/physical damage section of the policy.\nStorm Plan:\nA few yacht insurance policies require the yacht owner to fulfill their storm plan to be eligible for coverage.\nVerify Your Coverage Location:\nWhere your boat is secured during a hurricane could affect your coverage. Ensure that your marina or selected location complies with your plan\u2019s stipulations.\n7. Develop an Evacuation Plan\nIn extreme cases, you may need to evacuate the area. Don\u2019t leave it until the last minute\u2014have a plan in place for yourself and your crew.\nEvacuation Routes:\nFamiliarize yourself with nearby roads, shelters, and evacuation routes well in advance of hurricane season.\nSafety First:\nIf you\u2019re unable to secure your yacht in time, prioritize your personal safety. Ensure you have an evacuation plan for you and your crew, and always keep life-saving equipment, such as life jackets and a fully charged phone, on hand.\n8. Be Prepared to File Claims in Case of Damage\nWhen a loss occurs, boat owners should take prudent measures without delay to prevent further damage to their yacht and save the receipts to review with an adjuster.\nDocument Your Yacht:\nTake detailed photos or videos of your yacht and all of its equipment before the hurricane season begins. This documentation can help in the claims process if you need to file a loss after the storm.\nNotify Your Insurance Company:\nIf your yacht has been affected by a hurricane, it\u2019s crucial to act swiftly and efficiently when contacting your insurance company. Here\u2019s a simple guide to help you navigate the claims process:\nBe Clear and Detailed:\nWhen speaking with the claims adjuster, be thorough in describing the damage. Provide all the necessary documentation, including photographs, a list of damages, and any other evidence required. The more precise you are, the faster the claims process will go.\nUnderstand the Next Steps:\nAsk your insurer about the next steps, including when an adjuster will assess the damage, what forms or documents are needed, and how long the process will take. This will give you a better idea of what to expect.\nFollow Up Regularly:\nStay in touch with your insurance company to track the status of your claim. Regular follow-ups can ensure that your case is moving forward and that any additional information needed is provided in a timely manner.\nFinal Tips for Hurricane Season\nPreparing your yacht for a hurricane is no small task, but taking the proper precautions can help protect your vessel from severe damage. From securing your yacht in a safe location to ensuring your safety systems are functioning, each step you take will increase the likelihood of your yacht surviving the storm. Always stay informed, and don\u2019t hesitate to evacuate if necessary. With the proper preparation and planning, you can face hurricane season with peace of mind knowing you\u2019ve done everything you can to protect your yacht and crew.\nHurricane prep isn\u2019t just about protecting assets. It\u2019s about prioritizing safety, both for your yacht and all who sail aboard it.

From the marshy Everglades to the tarpon-rich waters near Boca Grande, it\u2019s a boater\u2019s paradise. Join the ranks of those discovering the restorative nature of boat life.\nHere is everything you need to know about owning a boat in Florida.\nBasic Boat Safety Tips\nThe number one most important element to consider when purchasing a boat in Florida is the boating prowess of the owner.

Purchase a boat you are comfortable captaining. A vessel that is too large, or that demands more than your training level, may leave you sitting on the shore, uncertain. Research the different types of boats thoroughly and select one that you feel confident driving.\nHaving a high level of confidence regarding the craft you captain is the most basic of basic boat safety tips. The next \u2018must have\u2019 element for every boat owner is the\nboat safety kit\n, which should always remain aboard.\nJust as a Florida homeowner is advised to keep a hurricane preparedness kit just in case, so too must the Florida boat owner have a selection of items that help in the event of an accident or loss of power.\nCommon safety kit items\nFlashlight (and batteries)\n\u2013 Should your vessel break down in the nighttime hours, you\u2019ll be glad to have the illumination.\nEmergency radio\n\u2013 We\u2019ve all been in situations without a phone charger when we really need it. The emergency radio is there even if your cell phone isn\u2019t \u2013 a link between you and those on shore.\nMirror for signaling and whistle for alerting\n\u2013 Hold a mirror up to the sun, and you can deflect that sunlight far away. Even if your electronic equipment fails, that signal can be seen for miles. A whistle is a simple object that can help to alert others of your presence and need for help.\nProperly prepared first aid kit\n\u2013 There are many different types of first aid kits. Compile your own or purchase a kit specifically packed for Florida boaters. Inside, you\u2019ll find the usual bandages, ointments, etc. We recommend adding sunscreen to the mix (that Florida sun can be brutal, and if you\u2019re stranded, you\u2019ll be glad to have it).\nFire extinguisher and garbage bags\n\u2013 The need for the fire extinguisher is apparent, but garbage bags? \u2013 Yes, they are a worthy addition to the Florida boater safety kit. Use garbage bags as ponchos if it rains or to help conserve heat in cold weather.\nLife jackets\n\u2013 There needs to be one\nlife jacket\nfor every person aboard, regardless of age, even if they are expert swimmers. They should be approved by the U.S. Coast Guard.\nDuct tape, buckets, and ropes\n\u2013 Duct tape might not fix everything, but it can plug a small leak and give you enough time to get your craft back to shore. A simple bucket plays an important role if you need to bail out. And ropes are a must on any craft, at least to tie up to docks and rescue an overboard passenger.\nNow that you have the items necessary to make up a Florida boat safety kit, it\u2019s time to educate yourself regarding active, in-the-moment boat safety practices. Hopefully, if you follow the guidance of your boating safety class, you will never need the safety kit at all.\nRecommended Boating Safety Courses\nDid you know that you are\nrequired to take a boat safety course\n? If you are operating a motorized boat of more than 10 horsepower and were born during or after 1988, you are required to do so \u2013 an important part of keeping our waterways safe.\nLook for a course that is Florida-approved; different options exist, including online selections. We suggest this one from\nBoat Ed\n. You can also peruse the list curated by the\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission\nfor a solid list of options.\nAfter you\u2019ve aced your Florida boating safety course, make sure you know what to do if your boat breaks down or is involved in an accident. Knowledge gives peace of mind\u2013that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled this boating accident and breakdown guide for a quick snapshot regarding what to do if your Florida boat runs into trouble.\nBoating Accident and Breakdown Guide\nShould a boating accident or breakdown occur, do an immediate check of everyone aboard for injury and to see what medical attention, if any, is needed. Break out the Florida boat first aid kit and tend to any wounds. Then, call for help using your cell phone or the emergency radio aboard.\nWhat to do when involved in a boating accident\nDocument\nthe moment as much as possible. In the frenzy of stress that always accompanies a boating accident, major details can be lost. Take pictures of any damage and, instead of writing things down, you can dictate what happened and save the recording in your phone.\nDetermine if the U.S. Coast Guard should be notified\n.\nCall your marine insurance agent\nand let them know what has happened. Hopefully, you\u2019ve opted for comprehensive insurance protection that has you, your passengers, and your beloved boat covered.\nWhat to do in the event of a breakdown\nTry to move your craft out of the way\n, if possible, if you are on a heavily-traveled waterway. This could save your boat from a collision.\nCall the nearest harbor master,\nor break out the emergency radio and call for help. Different tow services exist to help boaters who are stranded, or the Coast Guard may come to your aid if appropriate.\nWhere to store your boat\nIt\u2019s important to know what to do\non\nthe water, but how are you protecting your boat when you\u2019re\nnot\nexploring the Florida waterways? There are several options available to you.\nStoring your boat in Florida is quite easy. You could leave it outside your residence\u2013keeping the vessel nearby and avoiding marina fees There are some drawbacks to this commonsense approach, however.\nExposing your craft to the elements\nis a surefire way for it to deteriorate more quickly. A pervasive example of this is upholstery. Even the most watertight boat cushions are going to eventually disintegrate, and the more you expose a boat to the elements, the quicker this will occur. You could keep your boat in the garage, of course, but the vessel will take up most of that valuable storage and parking space.\nLift storage\nPerhaps you have a lift outside your home, ready for your boat to be perched and lowered. This is a solid Florida boat storage selection, but make sure that if a hurricane or tropical storm looms, you\u2019ve taken the necessary precautions to keep that on-site boat secured.\nMarina storage\nStorage at a marina is another viable way to keep your boat safe and at the ready for future voyages. Often, marinas will offer security details\u2013but you should still never keep expensive equipment aboard when storing your boat.\nFor those who don\u2019t live on the water, or who don\u2019t want to keep a boat on their property, a marina can be a wonderful choice. Before you select one, make sure to thoroughly understand their\nrules and regulations\n, especially how easy (or difficult) it will be to access your craft whenever you\u2019d like.\nDry stack storage\nIn dry stacking, boats are placed on racks, often indoors and away from the elements. To retrieve your boat, you\u2019ll need to call the storage facility ahead of time and have it lowered and prepared to move safely to your trailer via forklift. This storage option is attractive to those who boat rarely or don\u2019t reside in Florida permanently.\nBoatyard storage\nBoatyard storage is a hybrid Florida boat storage option that combines dry stack storage with near-marina storage. In this case, the stacked boats are kept outside but not necessarily on the water. This is less expensive than marina storage and keeps you relatively close to an embarkation point. You\u2019ll need to follow the same call-ahead process you\u2019d use when dry docking.\nNo matter which Florida boat storage mode you select, resist the impulse to keep the vessel in the water for an extended period of time. Salt water is highly corrosive to boats and, for those not in salt water, weather damage can be catastrophic. At the very least, lift the boat out of the water and remove any electronic equipment and valuables after every excursion.\nImportance of marine insurance\nFlorida marine insurance is so absolutely vital. When it comes to everything you need to know to own a boat in this beautiful state, understanding marine insurance ranks near the top of requirements for safe boating.\nMarine insurance is the ultimate protection for your vessel. Consider it a sort of \u2018invisible life jacket\u2019 you carry with you as you navigate the waterways. Before you ever load the fishing gear and cooler, stock the first aid kit, or chart that first Sunshine State boating excursion, you must protect yourself, your passengers, and your vessel from the unexpected. No one can predict the future\u2013but marine insurance can safeguard you against many unexpected troubles.\nThings to consider when purchasing Florida marine insurance\nInsurance cost\ndepends on the type of vessel, the surrounding environment, the contents aboard, and how you\u2019ll use the boat. You will want to consider physical damage coverage and liability while also considering optimal coverages available to you.\nCall an experienced advisor\nto compile a\npersonalized policy\n, as it is easy to miss a vital part of insurance protection. A marine insurance advisor considers multiple elements before ever suggesting a policy.\nIf an accident were to occur\n, would your passengers\u2019 medical care be covered? Who is liable for those injury-related costs? Your marine insurance advisor can help answer these questions and propose solutions.\nPrepare for the worst and hope for the best.\nThat\u2019s what Florida marine insurance is there for\u2013 to protect you and your craft in a worst-case scenario, while allowing you to go on every voyage with the calm that comes from that protection.\nStay Protected with W3 Insurance\nFlorida marine insurance is the ultimate life jacket. Cover your vessel and those aboard, and set off to explore the Sunshine State\u2019s famous waterways. Stay covered with help from W3 Marine Insurance\u2013and bon voyage!

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Purchases made at convenience stores and discount stores may not qualify, but they can still earn the base rewards rate on a Discover card. Any spending at Walmart or Target will earn 1% back only.\n\u00bb MORE:\nSee our best credit cards for groceries\nWholesale clubs\nIf your Discover card is accepted at a wholesale club, you can earn bonus cash back on purchases there. Notably, however, Costco doesn't accept Discover cards. Wholesale club services like delivery services, travel and cell phone plans also won\u2019t earn the bonus rate. Individual merchants and stand-alone stores located within the wholesale clubs or online may not qualify either.\n\u00bb MORE:\nSee our best credit cards for Costco purchases\nSelect streaming services\nThis category is a repeat from Discover\u2019s first-quarter picks of 2025.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Technically, you earn 5 SoFi \"reward points\" per $1, but those points are worth 1 cent each. Redemption options include a deposit into a SoFi checking and savings account, a statement credit, or as payment toward any SoFi loans.\nHowever, there are some caveats to be aware of:\nBecause it's a\ncharge card\nand not a credit card, you won\u2019t be able to carry a balance on the SoFi Smart Card and must instead pay it off in full each month.\nSecondly, while the card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee, you must have a SoFi checking and savings account and a SoFi Plus membership, which costs $10 a month. (Your account balances determine your spending limit with the card.) You'd need to spend at least $200 a month at grocery stores using the SoFi Smart Card to earn enough in rewards to offset that membership cost.\nThe card doesn\u2019t earn rewards on any other purchases.\nOn the plus side, there\u2019s no\nhard credit pull\nrequired to apply for the SoFi Smart Card, which protects your credit scores from the temporary dip that can happen from a credit inquiry.\nAnother unique feature of the SoFi Smart Card is how it\u2019s integrated with the cardholder\u2019s checking and savings account to prevent overspending. When a purchase is made with the SoFi Smart Card, the amount of that purchase is \u201creserved,\" meaning those funds are no longer accessible to make other purchases until the card balance is paid.\nIt's similar, in some ways, to how a debit card works. But unlike a debit card, the SoFi Smart Card reports to all\nthree major U.S. credit bureaus\n, so it can help you build your credit.\n\u00bb NEXT:\nNerdWallet's best credit cards for groceries\nAbout the author\nJae Bratton\nJae is a writer for the credit cards team at NerdWallet.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Currently, the card is issued and serviced by Goldman Sachs. The transition is still subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\nIf you\u2019re an existing cardholder, you can expect to be transitioned to the new issuer in about 24 months. What does that entail? Full details aren't yet available, but Chase and Apple offered a glimpse in their recent announcement.\nHere\u2019s what we know:\nMORE:\nSteps to take when your credit card switches issuers\nEarly details\nIf you're an existing holder of the\nApple Card\n, you will not need to reapply for it. During the transition, you can continue to use the card in the same manner. It still earns:\n3% cash back on Apple purchases and\nat select merchants\nlike Nike, Uber, Walgreens and more, when you use the Apple Card with Apple Pay.\n2% cash back on all other purchases when you use the Apple Card with Apple Pay.\n1% cash back on purchases made with the physical Apple Card.\nThe\nApple Card\nwill continue to have no annual fee, no late fees and no foreign transaction fees.\nMastercard\nwill remain the payment network, meaning the card will still be broadly accepted globally.\nYou can keep managing your account in the Wallet app and at\ncard.apple.com\n. If you have a savings account, it will remain accessible. It's also still possible to purchase Apple products with the card\u2019s monthly installments feature when you use it to check out at Apple Store locations and via Apple\u2019s website and app.\nFor customer service inquiries, continue contacting Apple Card support in the Wallet app or at\nsupport.apple.com/apple-card\n.\nStay tuned\nOnce the transition is complete, your balance will be with Chase. If there are any instructions regarding card number changes, physical card changes or other details, they should be provided to you as the transition date approaches.\n\u00bb MORE:\nBenefits of the Apple Card\nAbout the author\nMelissa Lambarena\nMelissa is a credit cards writer at NerdWallet.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.

Previously, he was a homepage editor and digital content producer for Fox Sports, and before that a front page editor for Yahoo. He has decades of experience in digital and print media, including stints as a copy desk chief, a wire editor and a metro editor for the McClatchy newspaper chain.\nManaging Editor\n+\nmore\n\u00bb This article is out of date\nThe promotion described in this story has expired.\nSoccer fans who apply for the\nBank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card\nor\nBank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card\nwill have a chance to access tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2026\u2122. For a limited time, new cardholders will potentially be able to purchase up to two tickets next year to select matches next year.\nThe offer is available only if you submit an application between Dec. 4, 2025, and Jan. 5, 2026, and the account must be open and established by Feb. 5, 2026, to qualify. A Visa card will be required to make the purchase.\nHere\u2019s how you can use this offer to potentially buy tickets.\n\u00bb MORE:\nNerdWallet's best credit cards for sports fans and athletes\nHow it works\nThere are a few key steps to complete for the chance to get tickets, and even then there\u2019s no guarantee. Thousands of tickets are offered while supplies last or until Feb. 24, 2026, on a first come, first served basis.\nStrategize your play\nBe prepared to map out your strategy. Eligible cardholders will receive an email on Feb. 10, 2026, at approximately 12 p.m. E.T. from Bank of America\u00ae with a link to the FIFA ticket website. Only one link is allowed per individual.\nMake sure your email address is up to date because every second counts. If Bank of America\u00ae doesn't have your email address, you can log into your account online or via the app to get the same link. It\u2019s also recommended to\nset up a FIFA ID\nin advance to save time upon checking out, according to Bank of America\u00ae\u2019s news release. You'll need that ID to purchase tickets.\nPlay forward\nTicket prices will vary by match, but the Bank of America\u00ae cards may offer a way to offset some of the cost.\nHere\u2019s how you can make the most of them:\nBank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card\n:\nThis card earns 3% cash back in a bonus category of your choice from a list (plus an additional 3% bonus in the first year), as well as 2% back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, on the first $2,500 in combined spending across all those categories per quarter. All other purchases earn 1% back. There's also a welcome bonus that can put some money back in your pocket: Receive a\n$200 online cash rewards bonus after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\nPlus, the card offers a promotional interest-free window that could help you pay down the cost of tickets over time. You'll get a\n0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases, and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. After the Intro APR offer ends, a Variable APR that\u2019s currently 17.49%-27.49%  will apply\n.\nBank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card\n:\nIn the first year of opening the account, you\u2019ll earn an unlimited 2% cash back that you could apply toward those ticket purchases. After that, you\u2019ll get 1.5% cash back. This card also comes with a welcome bonus: Get a\n$200 online cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of your account opening.\nAnd its promotional APR offer can also offer some breathing room: Receive a\n0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases, and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. After the Intro APR offer ends, a Variable APR that\u2019s currently 17.49%-27.49% will apply\n.\nFIFA World Cup 2026\u2122 ticket prices vary but they aren't cheap, so it\u2019s important to only charge them to your credit card if you know you\u2019ll be able to pay off the balance within the 0% introductory APR window.\n\u00bb MORE:\nBank of America\u00ae Preferred Rewards: What to know\nBe a good sport\nTickets to the FIFA World Cup 2026\u2122 can be hard to come by. Outside of this promotion, you can purchase tickets through sales phases available exclusively on FIFA\u2019s website. As of now, FIFA has offered a Visa presale draw exclusively for Visa cardholders and an early ticket draw that required an application process followed by a randomized selection. The next phase is the random selection draw, which required applications for specific matches.\nTicket sales for this offer are non-refundable and cannot be transferred, unless you do so through FIFA\u2019s official resale platform and pay the resale administration fee. An unauthorized resale may cancel the tickets without a refund.\nAbout the author\nMelissa Lambarena\nMelissa is a credit cards writer at NerdWallet.

Drying off the inside of your boat after using it or washing it is a big thing in terms of extending its lifespan and keeping damp-loving mold and mildew at bay. Here are three great options for drying your boat\u2014effective on their own and even better in combination.\nCleantool Absorber Synthetic Chamois\nThe Dry:\nChamois are known for their ability to soak up large amounts of water while also being delicate enough to keep your surfaces safe from scratches and streaks. Cleantool claims the\nAbsorber\n, which is made of a synthetic PVA material rather than animal leather, can absorb water three times faster than a regular towel. It\u2019s machine washable and can be stored wet onboard.\nThe Sog:\nA single chamois costs over twice as much as a 12-pack of microfiber cloths. You might need more than one to dry down your boat.\nPrice:\n$15.99;\nwestmarine.com\nGrip On Microfiber Towels\nThe Dry:\nMicrofiber\ncloths\nare a great choice for drying your boat because they\u2019re not abrasive and won\u2019t scratch up your fiberglass, stainless-steel or plexiglass surfaces, and especially your electronic screens. Plus, they\u2019re cheap, at under $7 for a 12-pack. When they\u2019re soaked, you can hang them on the rails to dry or throw them in the washer and dryer at home. They\u2019re made of synthetic polyester rather than natural materials\nThe Sog:\nThey absorb water quickly so you may have to run through the entire 12-pack in one drying session.\nPrice:\n$6.99 (12-pack);\nwestmarine.com\nRead Next:\nHow to Clean Your Boat Without Dirtying the Environment\nWood Ranger Leaf Blower\nThe Dry:\nWhoever first thought of using a standard backyard leaf blower to dry his boat is a genius. The battery-operated Wood Ranger is a good choice for boat duty because its compact size means you can hold it singlehandedly and it\u2019s small enough to stow onboard. It\u2019s great for pushing water off a deck into the scuppers or blasting collected water out of stowage lockers, channels and other hard to reach places.\nThe Sog:\nIt stops drying when the 24-volt rechargeable battery runs out, which is reportedly around 15 minutes of continuous use.\nPrice:\n$69.99;\nwoodrangertools.com\nMore:\nAffiliate\n,\nboat cleaning and care\n,\nFebruary 2026\n,\nGear\nMore\nGear\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

This new Parker is powered by twin Yamaha engines with a maximum horsepower of 700. We have not yet run this boat, but have decades of experience aboard Parker\u2019s boats. Carolina-bred, its rugged build and hull design couples with the Yamaha propulsion and the Seakeeper Ride system that should deliver confident handling on the water.\nIt offers a self-bailing cockpit, which is a must for any boat on big water in our opinion. Its Coosa board transom won\u2019t rot and the fiberglass liner promises smooth style and easy maintenance. Parker adheres to the strict construction and rigging standards of the American Boat and Yacht Council and the National Marine Manufacturers Association.\nThe broad console features Garmin electronics.\nCourtesy Parker Boats\nThe 294 Fathom offers comfort and elegance on plush bow lounges with backrests. Couple this with the foldaway transom bench, customizable upholstery and perhaps a sun shade, and the 294 Fathom should serve nicely on sandbar days. A head in the console only adds to the comfort and convenience.\nAt the helm, the console features Garmin electronics to help you stay on course and find the fish. Overhead, a fiberglass T-top with powder-coated framework boasts nine rocket launchers, an electronics box, integrated LED spreader lights, speaker pods, LED courtesy lights, and two kingfish rod holders. With options such as a trolling motor or windlass, each 294 Fathom boat can be made unique.\nComfortable seating is found throughout the 294.\nCourtesy Parker Boats\nParker is, as of this writing, offering its boats at what it calls nationally advertised prices (NAP). This is a no-haggle price that you can buy a boat for. Hence, both the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price and NAP are shown above.\nParker, for all its salty tradition, crafted the 294 Fathom with a fresh, modern mindset. This boat blends the beating heart of serious anglers with the desire to create memories with family and friends afloat. If that sounds like you, don\u2019t place a down payment until you have seen this new Parker 294 Fathom.\nA fiberglass T-top with powder-coated framework is outfitted with a plethora of accessories.\nCourtesy Parker Boats\nHigh Points\nT-Top is as fully featured and as well-engineered as you are likely to find aboard a boat of any price.\nSpacious head inside the console provides convenience and comfort whether trolling on the blue water or enjoying a sunset\u00a0 cruise.\nStandard leaning post with armrests, aft-facing seats, rigging table, 22-gallon livewell, and tackle storage.\nThe bow seating is comprised of lounges with backrests that make sandbar days oh-so comfortable.\nFull, bolt-on transom bracket means you get all the boat length you pay for.\nPricing and Specs\nPrice:\n$313,166 (MSRP);\u00a0$238,800 (nationally advertised price)\nLOA:\n32\u20199\u2033 (with engines)\nBeam:\n9\u20195\u2033\nDraft (hull):\n1\u20198\u2033\nDry Weight:\n7,800 lb.\nPersons Capacity:\n12\nFuel Capacity:\n191 gal.\nAvailable Power:\nTwin Yamaha 250, 300, or 350 hp\nContact Parker\nParker Boats\n\u2013 Beaufort, North Carolina;\nparkerboats.com\nMore:\n2026 Boat Buyers Guide\n,\n2026 Boat Buyers Guide Fishing Boats\n,\nboat tests\n,\nBoats\n,\nFishing Boats\n,\nParker Boats\nMore\nBoats\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

The rectangular layout affords room for couches and lounges and just plain room to move around, that other boat types cannot offer at the same length. Most pontoon boats boast outboard power, with some multi-engine models capable of high speeds. Still, simple, modestly powered (and priced) pontoons are available from just about every builder. Still, again, many pontoons now come fitted-out with luxury, rivaling some runabouts in this regard.\n2025 Montara 2.0 23 CWDH\n2025 Sea-Doo Switch Fish 21\n2025 SunChaser Lucerne 20 LR DH\n2025 Sun Tracker Party Barge 20 DLX\n2025 Aura Quad Lounge\n2025 Princecraft Vectra 23 WRL\n2025 G3 SunCatcher Fusion 324 RC\n2025 G3 SunCatcher Select 324 SL\n2025 Bennington 24MSB\n2025 Manitou Cruise 22 Max Switchback\n2025 Viaggio Lago X22Q\n2025 Viaggio Diamante 22S AT\n2025 Helios GT-R 23\n2025 Regency 230 LE3\n2025 Ranger Reata 243C\n2025 Bennington 24 MFB Sport\n2025 Avalon Catalina 2585 Twin Cruise Rear Bench\n2025 Tahoe 2585 Cascade ELW\n2025 Avalon GeoFish CRF\n2025 SunChaser Calais 25 SB DC\n2025 Crest Classic 240 SLSC\n2025 Sylvan M-5 CLZ DC\n2025 Starcraft RX 25 Q DC\n2025 Bennington 25 RX Sport\n2025 Bennington 25QFBA\n2025 Manitou Explore 24 MAX Switchback\n2025 Balise Helix 24\nAdvertisement\nFeatured Videos\nBoat buyers have been relying on\nBoating\n\u2019s boat tests since 1956.

It\u2019s not that I\u2019m making bad choices. I\u2019m wearing my life jacket. I\u2019m a sober captain. I leave a float plan. But I\u2019m suffering from severe indecision, specifically about naming my boat. And by not naming my boat, according to tradition and legend, I risk incurring the wrath of Neptune. I convinced myself that Neptune was certainly too busy ruling over the Seven Seas to bother with a small lake in the North Woods. But then I did my research, and in the Roman religion, Neptune is the god of the sea and of fresh water. So there you go\u2014Neptune lurks at every launch ramp, checking to see if you\u2019ve cleaned the milfoil off your trailer.\nFaithful readers will recall the time the Lake View Inn gang pestered my good friend Chuck Larson into conducting an elaborate ceremony to rename his new Alumacraft, which involved positioning the boat with the bow facing due north at sunset, reciting a carefully crafted invocation to Neptune\u2014or Njord in this case\u2014and offering a tribute of Hamm\u2019s beer, \u201cFrom the Land of Sky Blue Waters \u2026\u201d. Chuck, of course, took this seriously and now he\u2019s been bugging me about naming my vintage Dunphy, a 14-foot mahogany plywood runabout.\nJust last Friday night Chuck cornered me in a back booth at the Lake View Inn, where I was watching the grandchildren open their pull tabs.\nCultural Interpretation: After our fish fry dinner I buy each grandchild $5 worth of pull tabs. This started as a distraction until one of them won $250, which their father promptly confiscated for the \u201ccollege fund.\u201d And, yes, preschool children do gamble in Northwoods\u2019 taverns so please mind your own business.\nAnyway\u2026Chuck slides into the booth and shares his thoughts.\n\u201cI know the lake is frozen but you\u2019ve got to come up with a name for the Dunphy before next season,\u201d Chuck said, \u201cespecially if you\u2019re taking these beautiful little children out on the water. How could you ever forgive yourself if Neptune decides to cast calamity down from the heavens? Maybe he sends a surf wake to swamp your little boat!\u201d\nI have been trying to come up with a name. There\u2019s some tradition that you name a boat after a wife\u2014but which one?\u2014or a daughter, but I have five of those. Some owners like puns such as\nSeas the Day\nbut does that work on a vintage boat? There are names that allude to a profession, so I could go with\nWriter\u2019s Block\nbut that\u2019s so corny. I asked my wife for an idea and she suggested\nBob\n, which was no help at all. She is only interested in staging the boat with mid-century accessories.\nRead Next:\nInstalling an Illuminated Boat Name\nI have got two ideas I think are pretty good. The first is\nDasher\nbecause for its vintage, this Dunphy has a rather rakish profile, a descending sheer and low freeboard aft. It\u2019s a dashing boat! The second is\nAnalog\n, because there is nothing digital about this boat. It doesn\u2019t even have a key. To shut down the Evinrude outboard I push the choke button on the dash. I could get a little fancy and go with\nAnalogue\nbut that\u2019s a bit pretentious. Save that for the Gar Wood find in a barn.\nSo, will it be\nDasher\nor\nAnalog\n? I asked the grandchildren, and the\u00a0 little 4-year-old looked up from his pull tabs and said, \u201cGrandpa, just name it\nBob\n.\u201d Neptune weeps.\nMore:\nHow-To\n,\nNovember/December 2025\n,\nOff My Dock\nMore\nHow To\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

Candidates must stand out in the category in which they reside or in the mission they are intended to fulfill. We do not pit a sport-fisher against a wakeboat, for example. Rather, if a wakeboat strikes us as a candidate, we assess how it innovates in that realm.

And with the Blackwood 270 LXF, a hybrid center-console from American Marine Sports, you\u2019ll arrive there in style. A cross between a bay boat and an offshore center-console, the 270 LXF can operate both inside and outside the inlet. Blackwood actually offers two versions, one with higher freeboard (4 inches) for the more offshore-inclined, and also the low-deck version that we tested.\nEither version is built with three-piece construction. The hull and stringer grid are bonded to the deck and injected with closed-cell foam up to the gunwale cap to ensure level, upright flotation and rugged durability. In addition to being chemically bonded, the deck is secured to the hull with through-bolts and the entire hull is reinforced with Kevlar. The result is a stout, yet sleek boat with a sharp entry that tapers to 20 degrees of deadrise at the transom. The 12-inch lifting pad at the transom helps the boat hop onto plane and generates lift under way. With twin Yamaha F300s, we pushed this boat to a 66-mph top speed while enjoying a generous cruising speed in the 40s. As this boat is designed to enjoy skinny-water fishing, it can still float in less than 2 feet of water with the engines trimmed all the way up. The standard Seakeeper Ride automatic attitude-adjustment system ensures optimal comfort.\nThe helm has space to fit two flush-mounted 16-inch MFDs from either Garmin or Simrad.\nCourtesy American Marine Sports\nOn the fishing front, the Blackwood 270 LXF features eight rod holders in the gunwale topsides, inwale rod storage on both sides, plus four more rod holders built into the hardtop. The leaning post hides a 25-gallon circulating livewell. Two 80-quart macerated fish boxes reside under deck hatches. The helm console features a full-glass enclosure to keep the captain and co-captain protected, with a great view of the twin flush-mounted MFDs on the dash. Two wireless phone chargers adorn the top of the console.\nComfortable bow seating has removable forward-facing backrests.\nCourtesy American Marine Sports\nThe family will love the 270\u2019s creature comforts, from the enclosed head to the flip-down transom bench with removable backrests, to the bow seating that has removable forward-facing backrests. Don\u2019t forget the cushioned seat forward of the console. Whatever you have planned for the day, the 270 LXF has got you covered.\nThe leaning post hides a 25-gallon circulating livewell.\nCourtesy American Marine Sports\nHigh Points\nLadders on the extended swim platforms extend out to the sides, away from the propellers to keep the crew safe at the sandbar.\nAll Deutsch connectors on the wiring are clearly labeled for easy maintenance and troubleshooting.\nRemovable backrests in the bow seating allow for lounging and stow away for fishing.\nSpace to mount two Power Poles on the transom.\nThe helm has space to fit two flush-mounted 16-inch MFDs from either Garmin or Simrad to easily navigate or monitor your ships systems.\nBlackwood 270 LXF Certified Test Results\nBoating Magazine\nHow We Tested\nEngines:\nTwin Yamaha F300s\nDrive/Prop:\nSaltwater Series II 15.25\u2033 x 18\u2033 3-blade stainless steel\nGear Ratio:\n1.75:1\nFuel Load:\n82 gal.\nCrew Weight:\n400 lb.\nPricing and Specs\nPrice:\n$300,000 (with test power)\nLOA:\n27\u20194\u2033\nBeam:\n8\u20198\u2033\nDraft:\n1\u201910\u201d\nDry Weight:\n7,700 lb.\nSeat/Weight Capacity:\nYacht Certified\nFuel Capacity:\n129 gal.\nContact American Marine Sports\nAmerican Marine Sports\n\u2013 Groveland, Florida;\namericanmarinesports.com\nMore:\n2026 Boat Buyers Guide\n,\n2026 Boat Buyers Guide Fishing Boats\n,\nAmerican Marine Sports\n,\nboat tests\n,\nBoats\n,\nFishing Boats\nMore\nBoats\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

BOTY is announced annually during an event at February\u2019s Miami International Boat Show, and in our March issue.\nFrom the 100 or so boats tested by each year\u2019s end, we select those that stand out the most in their category. Ongoing debate and discussion keep the contenders list fluid. The boats presented here are the results of all that on-water testing and all that team deliberation. From this select group, Boat of the Year 2025 will be chosen.\nCongratulations, Boat of the Year category winners!\nThe CrossWave delivers impressive capabilities for a nice price.\nCourtesy Yamaha\nFishing\u2014Small: Yamaha CrossWave\nWith the CrossWave, Yamaha just may have created a new category of boat. The CrossWave combines the shallow draft, capacity and speed of a fishing skiff while delivering the maneuverability, handling and sporty fun of a personal watercraft such as its WaveRunner cousins. Our team applauded this plunge into new territory, the feature set and also couldn\u2019t ignore the ability to deliver a boat that can do so much for a low price.\nRead Our Boat Test\nThe Ultr\u00e9 23ZX combines top-notch wakes and waves with luxurious appointments.\nCourtesy Tig\u00e9\nWatersports: Tig\u00e9 Ultr\u00e9 23ZX\nPronounced \u201cUltra,\u201d this boat is just that according to\nBoating\n\u2019s Tech Team. Features such as its FastFlip co-captain\u2019s chair, which deploys to face forward or aft, and the built-in Ultr\u00e9Chill upholstered electric cooler raise the luxury bar. Its cockpit is deeper than most tow boats, adding comfort and storage. The wakes and waves? We were blown away. Kudos to Tig\u00e9 for edging-out other boats in a category known for implementing high luxury and top technology.\nRead Our Boat Test\nThe 43 SAV is a versatile boat with an impressive build quality.\nCourtesy Regal Boats\nAdventure Boat: Regal 43 SAV\nMany boats claim to be the \u201cSwiss Army Knife of the water,\u201d but Regal\u2019s 43 SAV has an edge on all the others. It is equipped to fish, offers a great cabin for weekend cruising and its deck expands like that of a superyacht. The \u201cGarm-Rests\u201d (personal MFDs)\u00a0 at the helm impressed us, too, as did the fit, finish and build quality.\nRead Our Boat Test\nThe 670 LXS offers a layout that is as versatile as it is luxurious.\nCourtesy Scout Boats\nSport Yacht: Scout 670 LXS\nScout pushed the envelope on the 670 LXS, melding the latest in systems, propulsion and design to achieve the world\u2019s largest outboard-powered sport yacht. This boat impresses with features such as screens at multiple seating locations throughout, a retractable rocket launcher, and a layout that is as versatile as it is luxurious. Three staterooms, five mega outboards and 100 reasons to say \u201cwow!\nRead Our Boat Test\nThe Arc Sport produces great wakes and waves and provides comfortable amenities at the highest quality.\nTom King\nElectric: Arc Sport\nA boat must do more than simply utilize electric propulsion to earn top honors in this category. It must also stand-out in the growing category of boats it competes against. It happens that the Arc Sport is one of the best watersports boats we tested this year. It delivered excellent wakes and waves\u2014as we recorded on video\u2014utilizes two huge screens for boat and systems control, and it looks great and provides comfortable amenities at the highest quality.\nRead Our Boat Test\nThe 38 T-Top mixes a solid build with a plush ride.\nCourtesy Wellcraft\nCenter-Console: Wellcraft 38 T-Top\nThe 38 T-Top is a boat we had discussed as a team long before we saw it. \u201cWhen,\u201d we pondered, \u201cwill a center-console builder leave behind its fishing roots, keeping the bluewater-capable hull and build, and then fully embracing the comforts and features of a dayboat?\u201d Wellcraft answered our question with the 38 T-Top, the aft cockpit of which could be dropped into a luxury bowrider. With an overnighting cabin below, multiple outboards, and Nordic lines, it is hot.\nRead Our Boat Test\nThe 367CX is built to fish and entertain with ease.\nCourtesy Everglades Boats\nDayboat: Everglades 367CX\nThis boat caused a stir at its Palm Beach Boat Show debut in March 2025, drawing such a crowd that shooting our preliminary video proved hard to arrange. With its rotating cockpit module, the 367CX goes from all-out angling to all-out socializing without missing a beat. Head belowdecks and the comforts rival a cruiser. Head to the bow, via a unique portside door, and the sun lounge rivals a sport yacht. Throughout Everglades\u2019 first-ever crossover model, excellence is evident.\nRead Our Boat Test\nThe 2500 ULW is an all-around performer with a comfortable ride.\nCourtesy Godfrey Marine\nPontoon: Godfrey Sanpan 2500 ULW\nThis Sanpan\u2019s unique design delivers demonstrably better response to engine trim than other pontoons we\u2019ve tested, enhancing comfort, efficiency and the driving experience. Also, the outboard tilts clear of the water, an advantage for coastal boaters most pontoons do not provide. It boasts a special outer rail to which SUP boards, BBQ grills, flags and more can be carried. Its windshield and UltraLounge are so much icing on this pontoon\u2019s cake.\nWhy\nBoating\nAwards the Boat of the Year\nBoating\n\u2019s Boat of the Year (BOTY) honors the most remarkable new vessel introduced to the market. This boat excels in design, innovation, performance, and value, chosen from all models tested by\nBoating\n\u2019s Tech Team in a calendar year.\nThe guiding principle for selecting Boat of the Year\u2014indeed an important element of every boat test\u2014is the comparison to other boats with the same mission. A flats boat can\u2019t compare to a wakeboat and a cruiser has little in common with a PWC. For this reason, Boat of the Year is the boat that excels in its category more than any other boat excels in any other category.\nThis judgement is made by our editorial staff who are boat owners with over 200 years of combined\u00a0 boating experience, plus nearly 100 combined years professionally employed in evaluating boats of all types.\nRead Next:\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2024\nFirst and foremost, the award celebrates excellence in marine design by acknowledging builders who push design, engineering, and construction-quality boundaries. These vessels are not just products; they are advancements in safety, handling, efficiency, and user experience.\nThe BOTY award also serves as a valuable guide for consumers, particularly boat buyers, by highlighting boats that genuinely deliver on their promises. Rigorous testing ensures that each winner has been objectively assessed and verified for real-world performance, providing an authoritative signal to the market.\nAdditionally, the award seeks to foster innovation within the industry. It encourages boatbuilders to refine their boats and embrace new technologies. This progress spans propulsion, materials, ergonomics, and environmental efficiency\u2014helping, we believe, to drive the industry forward.\nEditorial integrity and leadership are cornerstones of BOTY.

How in the world are these going to be comfortable, or even functional?! Well, if they say to not judge a book by its cover, then I guess it\u2019s fair to say don\u2019t judge sunglasses by their arms\u2026or lack thereof.\nOmbraz\nhave replaced traditional arms with Japanese marine-grade cord. The custom-woven nylon material is abrasion resistant, soft, and 100-percent recycled. Two ergonomic sliders sit at the back of the cord, allowing for quick and easy adjustments to the fit. To wear Ombraz, simply put the cord over your head, place the frames on your face and pull the sliders tight until comfortable. When I received a pair of Ombraz several months ago to test, I was convinced they would feel wobbly or too different to be usable. I was wrong. And many, many wears later, they have become some of my favorite, go-to sunglasses, especially when I\u2019m out on a boat. The frames are well balanced and rest comfortably on my nose, and the design and placement of the cord keeps them in place without hassle.\nRead Next:\nMore Sunglasses Tested\nOf course, the advantages of going armless are many. First and foremost, arms are breakable \u2013 and they are also known to loosen up or stretch out over time, especially for wearers with larger heads. Several of my favorite pairs of sunglasses no longer fit properly or even slip off because they\u2019ve become too loose. By getting rid of the arms and the requisite hinges, Ombraz have eliminated these issues, while simultaneously making their sunglasses more compact and packable. Replacing solid arms with ultra-soft cord removes the problem of ear fatigue. Another advantage to the cord-for-arms system is loss prevention. The cord is a built-in keeper, so you can easily pull the Ombraz off your face and let them hang from your neck.\nThe author, caught here in mid-test of Ombraz sunglasses.\nGarrett Cortese\nThe frames are created with an aerospace-grade TR-90 material that Ombraz claims are indestructible \u2013 even going as far as to back them with a lifetime warranty. The cord and adjustment tabs fall under that lifetime warranty, as well. The Carl Zeiss nylon lenses are scratch and smudge resistant, and Ombraz can be ordered with polarized or non-polarized versions. During testing, the Ombraz I\u2019ve worn with grey polarized lenses are clear, vibrant and great for on-water activities. While the cord-for-arms route requires two hands to properly put on and secure, I appreciate the other advantages and conveniences, especially the packability and durability. While you might have your doubts looking at them, all I can say is you\u2019ve got to try them. I guarantee Ombraz will change the way you think about sunglasses, while enhancing the way you see your world. At $160, they are also cheaper than most other premium eyewear offerings.\nOmbraz can be ordered in five different frame styles (in multiple colorways) with three different lens colors, and side shields can be added for an extra cost. The frames are also offered in regular and XL sizes. For folks with plus-sized heads like myself, this is a wonderful option.\nOmbraz Leggero (XL) w/ grey polarized lenses MSRP: $160,\nombraz.com\nMore:\nGear\n,\nsunglasses\nMore\nGear\nWhat to Look for in a Water-Purification System\nSterndrive vs. Outboard\nNew Tech-Laden Sea Ray Drops At CES: The SLX 360 OB Debuts\nFliteboard RACE Brings High Performance to Foiling\nRead More\nBrunswick Corporation Unveils Its Largest-Ever Showcase of Marine Technology and AI-Driven Boating Experiences at CES 2026\nTiara 39 LS: A Versatile Powerhouse in the Luxury Sport Line\nThe Importance of Engine-Room Inspections\nBoat of the Year Category Winners 2025\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nSubscribe\nRenew\nDigital Edition\nCustomer Service\nDo Not Sell\nABOUT US\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Us\nCareers\nFOLLOW US\nEmail Newsletters\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYouTube\nFIRECROWN BRANDS\nBoating\nCruising World\nSailing World\nSalt Water Sportsman\nSport Fishing\nWakeboarding\nYachting\nMany products featured on this site were editorially chosen.

It's a common story, but it almost never happens today. The sailors of the past could do it, in large part, because the water was as much theirs as anyone else's.\nIn every city near water in America, battles are raging between private developers and those who offer, or hope to offer, access to sailing. The stakes are high, with consequences that should concern all sailors.\nEarly settlers chose the intersections of America's navigable waterways, like where rivers meet rivers, lakes or oceans. Safe harbors, where boats might dock and transfer goods, were especially attractive. Shipping and fishing spawned industry and cities expanded, often along shorelines. You can see examples from Tampa to Cleveland, San Diego to Seattle, among hundreds.\nTo ensure that waterways would not be privately appropriated and that water withdrawals would be fair, the Public Trust Doctrine was established into Common Law in 1892. States have their own prescriptions, but generally the focus is on protecting public access to navigable, potable and recreational water, beaches and shorelines, and some land, minerals and animal populations.\nPublic Trust Doctrine straddles ideology. On one hand, it is progressive and civic. Everyone has access to water and it is free, or at very low cost. On the other hand, the economic benefits of development are massive. On the edges of public resources we find the most vibrant commerce and the highest property values.\nIn the wake and the spirit of the law, parcels of shoreside land were preserved as parks in cities. They were an instant hit, helping cities become centers of wealth. People packed the beaches because the views were good, the air was clean, the water was refreshing, and it was often possible to launch or moor a sailboat for a small or no fee. Markets sprung up nearby. Homes within walking distance were coveted. Recreational sailing was popularized in these places.\nToday, folks who want to spend their weekends sailing can form sailing centers or yacht clubs and meet on prime waterfront land because of the Public Trust Doctrine.\nYacht clubs generally fall into two camps: those who tip-toe a fine line between exclusive access and compliance with these rules, and those whose members are adept custodians of the Public Trust Doctrine, using it to leverage their mission and advocate for the sport.\nSailing centers have it a bit easier. These not-for-profit organizations offer sailing instruction from public land in mutually beneficial contracts with city governments. The city gets a sailing program for its citizens. The sailing center gets a place to launch its boats.\nIn any case, whether we launch a sailboat from a public dock, tie up in a marina, drop an anchor in a cove, sail from a yacht club or learn to sail at a sailing center, the right to float a boat off premium waterfront land is provided by the Public Trust Doctrine.\nFast forward to the housing bubble and economic downturn that have altered the landscape. As demand for land shot up in the 1990s and early 2000s, the value of the loveliest land, like city shorelines, increased the quickest. Prime condominiums and office towers went up as close to the water as possible. Not to be outdone, public marinas expanded services and overhead.\nMany offered floating docks, pools and spas, cable TV and wireless internet, and funky restaurants serving margaritas where you might catch a Jimmy Buffett impersonator. Seeking ever more traffic, and the tax windfall that comes from it, city councils developed a habit of granting land use exceptions. Stroll most retail boardwalks, visit a beachside theme park or explore a specialty nautical museum featuring anchors and touchscreen displays, and you are the consumer and yours is the wallet that these enterprises attract.\nThen came the economic downturn. Facing budget shortfalls, municipalities, thinking of docks as lucrative profit centers, began raising slip and mooring fees, even as demand dropped. So the waterfront public park is, for all practical purposes, no longer a park. Today, it is a means for cash-strapped cities to cover other losses.\nNationwide, the price to tie up a sailboat has risen eight times faster than inflation. Some cities no longer have public docks, having handed them over to contractors to run, sometimes on restrictive terms. For sailboat owners, it can seem impossible to find a mooring (I've seen 30-year waiting lists in some New England harbors). The perception that sailing is elitist, at least in terms of access, is becoming a reality as the waterfront is chipped away.\nMark Naud, who practices environmental and land-use law and advocates for the sailing center in Burlington, Vermont, says that the war has just begun and early battle reports are mixed. On one hand, the laws are strong. He's concerned, however, that the civic, cultural and economic genius of the Public Trust Doctrine has been forgotten. Not many of us stand up in defense of broad water access because we don't understand that we have it.\nSailing centers, he contends, can make a difference.\n\"Sailing centers embody a modern utilization of the Public Trust Doctrine,\" he said. \"The laws make it possible to have sailing centers and sailing centers provide access, in the spirit of the laws. Sailing centers teach sailing and help people play on the water in boats, but they also teach us that we all own these remarkable resources, and that as owners, it is in our interest to care for them.\"\nHow many times have you heard a graying sailor reminisce about beach-launching their dinghy? It could happen again, if we rally in support the Public Trust Doctrine, ensuring that the water is as much the kid's as anyone else's.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in On the Wind\nSave kids from nature deficit disorder by teaching them to sail\nFear is healthy at sea unless it makes you wig out\nA sail into the foggy abyss offers one of life's truly genuine experiences\nBargain boats found in old barns should star in fixer-upper shows\nIt floats!

It\u2019s not difficult know when you need new sails or the paint job and brightwork need attention. But figuring out if a battery upgrade is necessary and how to do it is at times less obvious. Odds are, though, that if the house batteries are more than five years old, you are going to want to think about replacing them. Wet-cell lead acid batteries have a life span of about five years. Some can be coaxed to perform longer, but their performance will degrade over time.\u00a0If you\u2019ve found that you are constantly charging the batteries or can\u2019t run many of the systems you\u2019d like to for long periods, it may be worth considering a battery upgrade as well.\nBoat Test\n2017 January 1 - 12:00 am\nPowerful passagemaker\nWith sleek, modern looks this cruiser is kitted out for long voyages at a quick pace\nBy\nRichard Reichelsdorfer\nAt first glance, the 54 is an impressive boat.

Hood 32, an elegant daysailer with the graceful lines of an International One-Design and the speed of a competitive racer.\n\u201cI wanted the boat to be drop-dead gorgeous and sail as good as it looks,\u201d said Hood, 57, who in 2009 saw himself in a dream, sitting by the big bay window in his kitchen while holding up a model sailboat in one hand. The sleek little boat with long overhangs was spinning gracefully, riveting his attention.\n\u201cI knew that was the shape I wanted. That was the vision, so I modeled the 32 after what I thought I saw,\u201d he said.\nFrom the dream came the first set of drawings, a collaboration by Hood and Ben Stoddard, then a member of the C.W. Hood Yachts design team in Marblehead, Massachusetts.\nChris Hood takes a break from building Hull No. 41 of his C.W. Hood 32.\nDesigning a boat is one challenge, building it another, but as often happens, marketing and sales proved the most difficult hurdle. Hood was about to invest in constructing a high-end daysailer at a time when competition among boatbuilders offering daysailers was fierce. It was a niche market that included companies like Alerion, Morris,Tartan and Hinckley. A few naysayers advised Hood to drop the idea, but he was determined. Such tenacity was not surprising, considering Hood grew up under the mentorship of his father, Bruce Hood, a talented chemical engineer for whom no project was undoable, and his uncle Ted Hood, the legendary yachtsman, designer, builder and sailmaker who captained the winner of the 1974 America\u2019s Cup.\n\u201cThe Alerion 28 started it all and quickly became very popular. When I decided to try this, Morris and Tartan were already building daysailers, and Hinckley had made one as well,\u201d Hood said. \u201cEveryone was jumping on the bandwagon.\u201d\nHood was convinced he could design and build a daysailer that would stand out from the others.\n\u201cI wanted something different. I wanted to go back to the days of daysailing in a boat that was elegant, comfortable and just happens to sail well. And I wanted it to look like an IOD but sail like a laser,\u201d he said.\nHood already knew plenty about IODs. In the mid-1990s his company was awarded a contract to construct IOD-class boats and he built 18.\nHood\u2019s goal was to build as pure a sailboat as possible, one meant for those who are out on the water to relish the joy of sailing without the burdensome weight and equipment found aboard cruising boats. The daysailer would be outfitted with a mast, rudder, self-tacking jib, quality sails and an electric motor, but without bunks, galley, winches and a head. As a result, it would weigh only 2,800 pounds, making it highly maneuverable and require little wind to get up and go.\n\u201cThe 32 can actually turn on its own length,\u201d Hood said, while seated in his modest office that\u2019s tucked in a rustic, historic building constructed in the late 1800s and long known as the home of the former Graves Boatyard.\nBefore moving forward with actual production, Hood consulted with longtime friend Bruce Dyson, a Marblehead resident, respected skipper and master craftsman known as \u201cthe IOD Whisperer\u201d for his efforts to rescue and restore\u00a0vintage sailboats.\nHappy sailors take a 32 for a spin.\n\u201cI asked Bruce if he\u2019d take a look at the design. He told me to send it over and he\u2019d get back to me in a few days,\u201d Hood said.\nAn hour after receiving the drawing, Dyson was on the phone with Hood, enthusiastically explaining that the design was inspiring and that he\u2019d be coming right over to the to discuss it. Dyson said he would be bringing along Frank Morse, an old friend and\u00a0\u00a0Marblehead sailor who just happened to be in the market for a new boat.\nHood recalled how Morse came straight to the point.\n\u201cFrank asked me, \u2018You going to build it?\u2019 And I said, yes, if I\u2019ve got a customer. That\u2019s when Frank looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m your customer.\u2019 So all of this became possible because of that one man, Frank Morse.\u201d\nWhen Hood suggested Morse come up with a name for the boat, the sailor answered with one word\u00a0Dream\u00a0because he couldn\u2019t have dreamed of a better boat. Morse has since passed away, but his son Christopher Morse continues to sail hull No. 1.\nSoon after Frank Morse lent his support, Marblehead resident Tom McManus contracted for hull No. 2, which was followed by another order from a Seattle sailor for hull No. 3. Morse\u2019s boat debuted in 2011. As word spread, sailor Marc van den Kuur purchased hull No. 6 to sail in Holland. The orders continued to arrive, slowly but steadily as a dozen years ticked by. Hugo Salinas Price purchased hull No. 16, which he sails in Acapulco, Mexico. Then came a purchase order that gave the Hood 32 an unprecedented boost. America\u2019s Cup tactician and sailing television commentator Gary Jobson took claim to hull No. 17 and named it\nWhirlwind\n.\nThe 32-foot daysailer comes together in the shop in Marblehead, Massachusetts.\n\u201cThese days, I sail it on average once a week. It\u2019s on a hoist so I can sail whenever I like,\u201d said Jobson, whose home port is Annapolis, Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s not an overnight cruiser and it\u2019s not a race boat. It\u2019s just perfect for two or three people to fit comfortably.\u201d\nJobson took ownership of his Hood 32 in 2015.\n\u201cI just love the way the boat sails. It\u2019s a rocket ship downwind,\u201d he said. \u201cI typically use the boat for short sails, two to four hours, with one or two people coming aboard. It makes for good, long conversation. Or else I do a longer sail, five to eight hours, and stop along the way for lunch.\u201d\nLike other Hood 32 owners, Jobson appreciates the boat\u2019s simple, no-fuss design, which makes it easy to spontaneously decide to go for an hour sail.\nHood replaced the earlier battery-powered motor in Jobson\u2019s boat with a different model after some discussion. The first in a series of electric motors powered by lithium batteries had been introduced in the Hood 32 in 2012. Buyers were given the option of an electric outboard motor called the Torqueedo, which is clamped to the hull, or the Mastervolt PODMaster sail-drive propulsion system that took up space inside the boat.\n\u201cMy boat has a prop that feathers. It\u2019s not a folding prop. If you turn the motor on, the prop spins as you\u2019re sailing so you can charge up the battery,\u201d Jobson said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great feature.\u201d\nAt the U.S. Naval Academy graduation in Annapolis in May, Jobson flew his spinnaker and tacked amid hundreds of boats during a lull in the ceremony while awaiting the Blue Angels show team flyover.\n\u201cEveryone from that fleet of boats was cheering us on because there we were, tacking our way through them with the spinnaker flying,\u201d he said. The maneuver generated plenty of excitement over the nimble daysailer.\nTwenty-four more Hood 32s were built after Jobson\u2019s\nWhirlwind\nand four others are currently on order, bringing the total number of hulls to 45.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building hull No. 41 right now,\u201d said Desmond Binger, a craftsman and mechanic who has been building boats at C.W. Hood Yachts for the past 22 years, hand-laying the fiberglass hull, monitoring the infusion process, and participating in the woodwork finish. \u201cThese are fine boats. Everything about them is quality.\nLOA 32\u2032 5\u2033; LWL\u00a021\u2032; Beam\u00a06\u203211\u2033; Draft 4\u2032; Displacement\u00a0\u00a02,825 lb.; Sail area\u00a0285 sq. ft.; PHRF rating 147\nSteve Pfeifer would agree, calling attention to details such as the wood coaming that runs the entire perimeter of the cockpit.\n\u201cChris is a pleasure to work with,\u201d said Pfeifer, who sails his Hood 32\nYoung America\nout of Sister Bay, Wisconsin. \u201cI singlehand mostly and I told Chris I wanted an autopilot. He installed it as part of the other instrumentation, in a way so that there aren\u2019t different electronics and separate keypad controls all over the cockpit. I also have the electric motor in mine, so I don\u2019t worry about the doldrums that can sweep in here.\u201d\nPfeifer opted for the carbon fiber mast and rudder combination, the GPS and several other upgrades.\n\u201cI wanted something elegant but with modern performance,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore this boat, I was with the IOD circuit, then the J/24s, the 505s, the J/105s, and there was a J/22 in there someplace before I bought a J/100. But this boat fits the bill.\u201d\nJim Issler and his wife, Heather Jeltes, are equally enthralled with their daysailer.\n\u201cWhen we first saw that boat sail by, we fell it love with it,\u201d said Jeltes, recalling they stopped to have a closer look while heading along the dock to the yacht club. \u201cThe next day, Jim ordered the boat.\u201d\nThe Connecticut couple previously owned two smaller boats\u2014 a Marshall Sandpiper catboat and a Buzzards Bay 14.\n\u201cSo unlike many, my sailboats are getting bigger. That being said, we get so many compliments on the boat. There are many experienced sailors considering down-sizing to the Hood 32,\u201d Jeltes said.\nJeltes enjoys singlehanding\nUccello III\n, which she finds easier to sail compared to their previous boats.\n\u201cIn the beginning I was a bit trepidatious, but I immediately found she was a beauty to handle in all winds. I so love the boat.\u201d\nDavid Daigle sails his 2020 Hood 32\nSwitchbac\nk\u00a0out of the Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich, Connecticut, currently homeport to three of the daysailers.\n\u201cThis is only our second sailboat as we have mostly owned powerboats.\u00a0When we bought\u00a0Switchback, we owned a 50-foot Grand Banks Eastbay that we used for cruising, so we wanted a daysailer that we could sail from our club with ease.\u201d\nWhile the boat can be singlehanded the cockpit is just as comfortable with six, he said.\n\u201cWe love the low freeboard and how close to the water you feel when sailing.\u201d\nThe three Hood 32 owners in Greenwich have raced at the club and are talking about a larger regatta.\nSmall fleets of Hood 32s have emerged in Newport, Rhode Island, and in Connecticut along the shores of western Long Island Sound. Other have loosely assembled in Maine, and while these fleets may not currently engage in frequent racing, owners are already talking about organizing a regatta. Most Hood 32 owners are age 60 and older.\nThe price of a new Hood 32 typically ranges from $150,000 to $165,000, depending on customizations such as a carbon mast and advanced electronics. Only one pre-owned model was for sale during spring 2023 with an asking price of $85,000.\n\u201cMost of the boats get passed along by word of mouth and never come on the market,\u201d Hood said.\nAlthough the boat is built without a head, causing some consternation among those who might be out on the water for longer than the prescribed four-hour sail, owners have tested some options.\nJobson lashed a portable toilet aboard for five years but claimed nobody ever used it. He has since tried a plastic-coated steel bucket contraption, but again said it goes unused.\nRuminating on the success of the Hood 32 while celebrating the milestone of hull No. 45, Hood looks back fondly on his Marblehead childhood that included plenty of messing around with boats.\n\u201cGrowing up, I had a Widgeon when I was seven or eight years old. But my favorite was the IOD, which I rebuilt with my dad when I was about 13,\u201d he said.\nThat was about the same time he built a tender and christened it Ocean 1. The tender with its simple design packed some surprising features for its time, including injection-molded construction, self-bailing cockpit and roller reefing.\n\u201cBetween my father and uncle, we were always doing something around boats. Every waking moment was on the boat if the weather was good. I still remember there were tools everywhere, in the cellar, in the garage, starting with my grandfather, Ralph, who would always say, \u2018If it\u2019s broken, we\u2019ll fix it.\u2019 My father had the same old-Yankee attitude and he could fix or make just about anything. He once wanted a new autopilot for his boat, but he only bought the compass and did the rest of it himself,\u201d Hood said.\nA father of three grown children with his wife, Nancy, Hood showed similar talent as a young man. He had studied architecture but lacked formal training in boat design or construction. The first boat he built outside his childhood and teenage projects was a 24-foot Cape Dory trawler. His uncle Ted had acquired Cape Dory molds in the late 1990s.\n\u201cAll of the Cape Dory boats were built so well. That\u2019s why so many of them are still out there,\u201d Hood said.\nTed Hood also gave his nephew the mold for the Wauquiez 26 powerboat, which was another turning point in the younger Hood\u2019s professional career. \u201cWe built 45 of them,\u201d he said.\nHood was building power boats shortly before taking on the daysailer project. He and his staff had spent a year building a 43-footer.\n\u201cWe were just finishing up. Things were coming to an end,\u201d he said, describing the alarm he felt at facing a clean slate. \u201cI remember saying to myself, when this is done we won\u2019t have anything to do.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when the Hood 32 entered his sphere and the dream became reality.\n\u201cIf a boat is beautiful, you won\u2019t forget it,\u201d Hood said.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Features\nThey just did it\nWhat to do when it goes bang\nNew Boats for 2025\nBreaking the fiberglass ceiling\nHove to in the gales of Biscay\nCruising at the bottom of the world\nSpring Boat Show Time\nSailing into no man's land\nSerious fun on and off the water\nSpring spruce-up\nAlso from David Liscio\nBeneteau 393\nAlerion Express 28\nC&C 37/40\nRig tuning\nHow to optimize for shorthanded sailing\nCabo Rico 38\nBargin Boats to Sail Now\nHunter Vision 32\nChasing a dream\nThe wide, wide world of multihulls\nSubscribe\nFollow Us\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to get the latest from SAILING Magazine delivered via email.\nEmail Address\n*\nEmail Format\nhtml\ntext\n*\nindicates required\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nPowered by\nWEHAA.COM\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Sailing Magazine, All rights reserved.\nClose\nClose\nClose",

That could be the mantra for JP Baudains and his partner Charlotte, who had a dream to sail the world, but, while in their late 20s, assumed the plan would include waiting several years to be able to do it. But then they decided to just do it, and three months later, in May 2022, they bought a 50-foot German Frers-designed Fast 500.\nSince then the pair have embarked on a frantic refit and the start of their goal to sail around the world and hopefully inspire people along the way, something they call Project World Sail.\nLongtime sailors JP Baudains and his partner Charlotte thought their dream of circumnavigating was something they\u2019d fulfill far in the future, and then they found their Fast 500\nJacquea\n.\nCate Brown photo\nNeither JP or Charlotte were strangers to sailing and the sea. JP grew up surfing and racing sailboats in the British Isles\u2019 Guernsey, and Charlotte\u2019s father was a sailboat captain. They both became professional sailors, sailing and racing on some of the most prestigious yachts in the world, and they met along the way.\n\u201cEvery time we would pull into a new anchorage working on someone else\u2019s boat, we couldn\u2019t help but feel a little envious of our neighbors owning their own boats, running their own schedules and following their own dreams,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cSo that was it. Neither of us remember quite when we made the decision to buy a boat and sail round the world, but all of a sudden it was happening, and the boat search commenced.\u201d\nThe couple had just sailed a boat from the Caribbean to Newport, Rhode Island, when they found their future boat.\n\u201cDriving up to see her after work was, if anything, a little underwhelming,\u201d JP said. \u201cSquashed into the back of a boatyard shed, decks covered in dirt and the interior completely ripped up, this boat was far from the vision we had. However, when we started to look a little closer, underneath the layer of dirt we saw a boat that had been beautifully designed to sail offshore, and do it fast.\u201d\nThe boat needed a lot of work, particularly considering the pair hoped to launch the boat and sail across the Atlantic by late August. They didn\u2019t get started until June and the worklist covered a whole wall. The previous owner told the couple they we were doing more to the boat in a couple of months than he had done in 18 years.\nThe couple sometimes worked 20-hour days whipping the boat in to shape, and making their August deadline, launching the newly named\nJacquea\n\u2014a word they make up during a Scrabble game\u2014in the middle of the month.\nWith the start of the hurricane season breathing down their necks, the pair prepared for four weeks at sea and set off out of Newport. They arrived at Cape Cod Canal at sunrise, with the current pushing them along with only a breath of air.\nBut their trip would be unceremoniously upended. A loud noise signaled a major issue: The mechanism that joins the propeller shaft to the engine failed, bending the shaft and cracked the shaft log. The boat was taking on water with no engine or steerage as the current pushed them through the canal.\nSails were quickly raised, and the Canal Patrol called on the VHF. When they arrived, they brought an emergency pump and towed the boat to a local marina.\nJacquea\ngot a replacement shaft, but the couple\u2019s plan was disrupted almost before it began. The unexpected work meant that crossing the Atlantic would have to be put off, but the couple adjusted and explored the East Coast and the Caribbean, then finally crossed the Atlantic, spending the summer sailing and surfing in remote Scottish islands. Another Atlantic crossing east-to-west is imminent.\nCharlotte and JP now enjoy having their own boat.\nCate Brown photo\nThe pair fund their journey partially through a rental property but also occasionally work as freelance sailors, doing deliveries or races. They also have sponsors, including Ocean Bottle, that offer support.\nAlong the way, Charlotte and JP, who occasionally have friends join them onboard, also work to bring people who might not have the opportunity to learn to sail on\nJacquea\n.\n\u201cWe try to touch base with local sailing communities when we reach an area, and they usually have an outreach program we can connect with people through,\u201d Charlotte said.\nAnd that gets to the heart of what this young couple is trying to do.\n\u201cSailing around the world was a bit of a by-product of what we really wanted here which was to have the opportunity as humans to push ourselves mentally and physically more than we have done before,\u201d JP said. \u201cWe wanted to see what just us two could do alone. Since then we have faced situations where we were tested to the limit with only each other to trust and when you\u2019ve made it through those situations then that pretty anchorage in the Caribbean that you reach at the end feels a little more rewarding.\u201d\nAnd while proving something to themselves was part of what led them to set sail, they now have another hope: that others might find inspiration in their story.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing what we\u2019re doing to prove that we are different, but instead to hope that we can inspire as many people as possible to follow their dreams. We didn\u2019t have a huge amount of savings but were clever with what we had, making it go as far as possible. If that inspires other people to stop talking about it and do it, then we are happy.\u201d\nFollow Project World Sail at their website\nwww.projectworldsail.com\nand on social media at the same name.\nJacquea\nget put through her pacesoff Newport, Rhode Island.\nElevate Drone Media photo\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Features\nWhat to do when it goes bang\nNew Boats for 2025\nBreaking the fiberglass ceiling\nBuilding a dream\nHove to in the gales of Biscay\nCruising at the bottom of the world\nSpring Boat Show Time\nSailing into no man's land\nSerious fun on and off the water\nSpring spruce-up\nAlso from SAILING Magazine\nNew Boats for 2025\nSpring Boat Show Time\nSpring spruce-up\nIllustrated guide to fitting out\nGuide to fitting out\nEnd of an era\nJanuary/February\nGifts for sailors\nHow to mount deckware\nNovember/December 2024\nSubscribe\nFollow Us\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to get the latest from SAILING Magazine delivered via email.\nEmail Address\n*\nEmail Format\nhtml\ntext\n*\nindicates required\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nPowered by\nWEHAA.COM\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Sailing Magazine, All rights reserved.\nClose\nClose\nClose",

The 393 was the first new model to be built at the U.S. plant.\nAs its digital designation implies, the 393 was part of Beneteau\u2019s number series. A fiberglass masthead sloop, it replaced the Beneteau 381 and was frequently described in reviews as a passagemaker capable of venturing offshore though not around Cape Horn. The 393\u2019s popularity is attributed to its open concept, creature comforts, smooth-running systems, and its departure from the boating industry trend of building narrow, cavelike designs that proved dark and sometimes gloomy below deck.\nThe natural light flooding the saloon and cabins from portlights and skylights put the 393 ahead of the competition. Most often categorized as a 39-foot recreational passagemaker, the 393 might not withstand rounding the seven capes, but was deemed strong enough by owners to safely cruise many parts of the globe by taking advantage of canals and other cut-throughs.\nThe sloop was introduced in the charter markets as the Oceanis 393 and Moorings 403. The design eventually morphed into the Beneteau Cyclades 39.3 for the yacht charter market in 2007, when the 393 was discontinued.\nFirst impressions\nThe 393\u2019s raked stem and reverse transom strikes a favorable chord with sailors in search of a cruising boat with style.\n\u201cApparently Beneteau has found there are still sailors who want boats that actually look like boats. I bet they\u2019ll sell a bunch of these handsome boats,\u201d Robert Perry wrote in a 2001 review in\nSAILING\nMagazine.\nIt was generally agreed by potential buyers that the 393 was good looking, featured clean lines and was built to take them where they wanted to go, which primarily was safely along any coastline on long passages in relative comfort and style. The 393 build quality was noteworthy for a production boat.\nConstruction\nBuilt by Beneteau in France and at the company\u2019s former factory in Marion, South Carolina, the 393 has a solid fiberglass hull and a balsa-cored deck.\nThe deck was attached to the beefy hull with a 3M 5200 type sealant. Structural support was added by the molded cabin liner and bulkheads bonded to the hull.\nThe aluminum deck-stepped mast supports two sets of swept spreaders. Standard equipment includes aluminum spars and stainless steel wire standing rigging.\nThe 393 was offered in two keel versions, a deep-draft fin at 6 feet, 3 inches and a shorter, weighted bulb just over 5 feet. The spade rudder was controlled by a destroyer-style steering wheel. Ballast in both options was iron, the keels attached with stainless steel bolts.\nThe decision by Beneteau to use iron instead of lead as ballast caused skeptics to raise concerns about possible rusting. Using lead would have been more expensive, add unwanted keel weight, and change the center of gravity\nWhat to look for\nThe earliest 393s are now more than 20 years old, prompting critics to wave red flags about possible loosened keel bolts, and aging electronics such as the chartplotter, radar and autopilot.\nLike any boat built two decades ago, a careful inspection of the engine, standing rigging and through-hull fittings should be undertaken. Oil and fuel leaks, cracked rubber hoses and worn belts are all basic signs the engine needs attention.\nSome owners report leaking at the curved deck windows above the saloon. Others recommend checking the keel for dings that could be telltale marks of a grounding.\nThe mainsail was designed to be raised by plastic slides in a track, equipment that could be stressed after two decades and cause the halyard to snag or resist. Harken rollers have been recommended by owners as a replacement.\nOn deck\nThe boat features a reverse transom with a slatted-teak swim platform, making it easy to board from an inflatable dinghy. A Bermuda rig masthead sloop, the 393 has a deck-stepped aluminum mast, which some sailors believe should have extended to the keel for strength.\nThe cockpit has teak seats. Control lines are directed to the cockpit and held fast by a row of clutches. Two Lewmar winches serve as primaries. A single, stainless steel, destroyer-style steering wheel occupies a central location in the cockpit.\nThe cockpit lazarette is spacious, providing abundant storage space for equipment or provisions. Four grabrails bolted to the cabintop provide a modicum of safety. Five hatches allow in light and ventilation to the saloon and cabins below.\nDown below\nThe saloon was designed as both roomy and airy, bathed in natural light via skylights and ventilated by hatches. The saloon\u2019s 6-foot, 6-inch headroom prevents all but the tallest sailors from bumping\ntheir heads.\nThe 393 was offered in both two-cabin and three-cabin options, the latter typically found among charter fleets or families with more than four members.\nThe L-shaped galley to port on the two-cabin models was appointed with a four-burner stove, refrigerator, freezer and double-basin stainless steel sink.\nThe three-cabin model features a linear galley to starboard but owners complain its layout is less efficient and not as social as an L-shaped galley.\nThe U-shaped settee together with the large oval dinette can seat six. The sleeping quarters were designed to comfortably accommodate four to six sailors.\nThe three-cabin model has a double Pullman berth in the bow, a U-shaped settee in the main saloon and two aft cabins, each with a double berth. It also has a nav station with a partition, giving it the benefits of a small office. Communication electronics and navigation instruments can be mounted and paper charts spread out with the nav station.\nThe two-cabin model has a nav station and more locker space. It has a Pullman berth in the bow and additional berths in the saloon and aft cabin.\nThe 393 has two heads. One is forward of the bow cabin, another starboard aft.\nThe hanging lockers are cedar-lined.\nEngine\nThe 393 was outfitted with a Swedish-built, 40-horsepower, Volvo diesel engine. Access is available from beneath the companionway steps and through two side panels. Engine noise is reduced by foam sound-proofing material inside the compartment. The engine bed is integrated into the hull liner. The engine control panel is located on the cockpit coaming. The boat has a stainless steel prop shaft.\nThe fuel tank holds 36 gallons, only marginally adequate for long passages.\nUnderway\nComplaints about the boat\u2019s performance in a seaway are few and far between. Hull speed is listed by the builder as 7.94 knots, enough to tantalize cruisers who harbor residual racing fever in their blood. The 393 is simple to reef.\nBeneteau 393 owner Stephen Kelley bought his boat\nMairead\n20 years ago, keeps it in Salem, Massachusetts, and has cruised to the Bahamas with his wife Margaret.\n\u201cAfter I retired from a career as a mechanical engineer, we did a nine-month and an eight-month cruise to the Bahamas. We\u2019ve also done several trips down the ICW,\u201d Kelley said, noting the boat\u2019s bulb keel lessened the likelihood of a grounding in shallow waters.\n\u201cWe have the two-cabin version and the layout is great. We love the L-shaped galley. There\u2019s a double Pullman berth just aft of the bow, and a head all the way forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a stack-pack on the boom that makes it easy to handle the full-batten mainsail.\u201d\nFrank and Jody Powers bought their 2006 Beneteau 393\nLehe Paine\na dozen years ago in Vancouver, Canada, and have been living aboard with their two children ever since. Their travels followed a route that matched Jody\u2019s station assignments as a U.S. Navy lieutenant commander, eventually taking them to Mississippi and later to Maryland by both water and land.\nDespite the lack of a washer-dryer, the adventurous couple has found their boat a suitable tiny home.\nConclusion\nThe stylish Beneteau 393 is an affordable, well-built production cruiser ideal for passagemaking with four sailors aboard or a perfect liveaboard for a couple.\nSAILING\u2019s Value Guide\n(5-star rating system)\nPrice:\nPrices for a Beneteau 393 in the United States in mid-2024 ranged from $99,000 for a 2006 model to $129,000 for a 2003 hull.\u00a03 stars\nDesign Quality:\nThe 393 was designed by Berret-Racoupeau Yacht Design in both two-cabin and three-cabin models. The designers were Jean Berret and Olivier Racoupeau, from the firm based in La Rochelle,\nFrance.\n3.5 stars\nConstruction Quality:\nA masthead sloop built by Beneteau in France and at the company\u2019s now defunct factory in Marion, South Carolina, the 393 has a solid fiberglass hull, balsa-cored deck, deck-stepped mast, spade-type rudder, and is considered high-quality for a production boat.\n3.5 stars\nUser-Friendliness:\nOwners report the boat is easy to sail, with lines led back to the cockpit and a helm strategically placed in order to reach them. There\u2019s plenty of room below deck that\u2019s well ventilated and illuminated by skylights.\n3 stars\nSafety:\nFour grabrails atop the coachroof, perimeter lifelines, bow pulpit and stainless steel stanchions help keep sailors aboard. The boat has adequate iron ballast to keep it upright. It could use more hand holds down below to increase safety during rough\nseas.\u00a03 stars\nTypical Condition:\nThe two-cabin owner\u2019s model is preferred by couples and small families. These boats tend to be well maintained. The three-cabin version is more popular in the charter fleets where they were used by dozens of sailors for brief trips that can result in heavier wear and tear. \u00a03 stars\nRefitting:\nHundreds of 393s were launched and as a result parts are easier to acquire compared to those for custom-built cruisers. Obtaining parts in the U.S. was made more difficult after the Marion plant was shut down. Owners recommend upgrades to a color chartplotter and radar display, and adding a radar arch that also supports the dinghy. Other recommendations include adding solar panels, an extra house battery to the electrical system, a high-output alternator, and a three-stage regulator. The boat\u2019s relatively small fuel tank means lashing extra jerry cans on deck when long-range cruising.\u00a0Beneteau stocked the boat with two halyards, main and genoa, but that doesn\u2019t take into consideration use of a spinnaker or help if one halyard gets hung up. \u00a03 stars\nSupport:\nBeneteau\u2019s production operation in Marion, South Carolina, has been moved to France, but customer support for parts and service in the United States is still managed domestically. The company\u2019s website www.beneteau.com advises boat owners to contact their local dealers when seeking support. The website lists 71 dealers in the U.S.\u00a02.5 stars\nBeneteau previously received the boating industry\u2019s CSI award for its excellence in boat production and customer service. Some information can be found online through lively discussion groups of Beneteau owners at www.groups.google.com/g/beneteau-owners.

Schanen\nA boat brought back from the dead created a legacy of craftsmanship\nThe first time Bruce Dyson laid eyes on his boat\nGypsy\n, it could barely be considered a boat. Pulled from the bottom of New York Harbor, the International One Design\u2019s deck was destroyed, the first four feet of bow was missing along with the transom, the mast was broken and there was a hole in the port quarter \u201cthat you could walk through.\u201d It was a victim of what became known as the \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d in 1991 but Bruce saw something in the boat that made him think he could bring it back to life again.\n\u201cI determined it was repairable as the lead keel was fine,\u201d he said.\nMany of his fellow Marblehead, Massachusetts, sailors weren\u2019t quite\nas optimistic.\n\u201cIt was the laugh of the town. \u2018Bruce\u2019s going to fix it?\u2019 Well, I fixed it and now it\u2019s the fastest boat in the Marblehead IOD fleet.\u201d\nThe elegant and stunning International One Design\nGypsy\nsails with her dedicated owner at the helm.\nHaving determined that because the boat had 10 ribs and a keelson that were in good shape it was \u201ca good boat to start with but I need to get it to float,\u201d Bruce spent a winter rebuilding the boat, which included replacing the missing bow, deck beams and deck and sistering about 20 frames. Then he replanked most of the port quarter. He used a solid piece of mahogany on each side of the boat and the back of the cockpit to replace the coamings and cabin sides. New floorboards and a mast step were also required.\n\u201cThen I sanded and varnished the interior of the boat, installed all new deck hardware, found a mast and a boom, acquired sails, painted, launched and raced it,\u201d he said, making the whole process seem much easier than it certainly was.\nThat shell of boat-turned-race winner became\nGypsy\n, so named because Bruce didn\u2019t have a mooring in Marblehead\u2019s harbor, and the boat would move around to any free mooring he could find.\nThe International One Design is a fine daysailer but it is primarily used in one-design fleets, where strict class rules and a healthy class organization make it the home of fun, competitive racing, at which Bruce, the 1998 class world champion, excels. He sails Gypsy out of Eastern Yacht Club in Marblehead and has traveled with the boat to big regattas like the IOD World Championship.\nBut it\u2019s not the quest for a trophy that makes sailing\nGypsy\nsuch a pleasure, Bruce said.\n\u201cSailing that boat wouldn\u2019t be half as much fun without the people on that boat and the tales they bring,\u201d he said.\nHis longtime crew consisted of what he described as \u201ca cast of characters, one more entertaining and interesting than the next.\u201d\u00a0 They included sailmaker Norm Cressy, Bernie Coyle, David Hooks and Sue Foight.\nIn fact it\u2019s friends and crew like those who are part of a perfect day of sailing, he said, although the competitor in Bruce also pictures a perfect day at the front the of the fleet.\n\u201cGetting three other people who are all great friends onboard, getting a great start, getting the lead, maintaining the lead and then stretching the lead. And a nice, cold beer on the way in is always nice,\u201d he said.\nThe boat was a mere shell of its former self after it sunk in New York harbor.\nAlthough the benefits of sailing in a well-run one-design class are certainly part of the IOD\u2019s charm, Bruce\u2019s love for\nGypsy\nstarts with her traditional design and is buoyed by her story of coming back from the dead. Although wooden boat ownership is not for the faint of heart and requires a steady amount of ongoing maintenance, Bruce said that the compliments he receives on how well she is maintained and how nice she looks, not to mention how fast she is, make the effort worth it.\nGypsy\n\u2019s owner does have a certain knack for rebuilding and maintaining IODs. He\u2019s owned four others and restored eight more over the years and along the way the man who was laughed at for trying to rescue a shell of a boat became known as the IOD Whisperer. When a hurricane damaged 12 IODs in Bermuda several years, the IOD Whisperer was flown in, housed and given all the materials he needed to repair all 12 boats in six weeks, living up to\nhis moniker.\nBruce and\nGypsy\nhave a long history together. There have been other boats, but for Bruce,\nGypsy\nremains \u201cthe one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to sail and beautiful to look at,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat more does a boy need?\u201d\nBruce Dyson at the helm after the extensive restoration.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in For the love of a boat\nWildwood\nAvocet\nMoon Dancer\nPrism\nPangaea\nHumble\nAlso from Erin L.

The boat seems like it\u2019s in great condition, and the survey went well. I need to make a 400-mile coastal delivery home and am trying to prioritize what I should worry about. There are places to stop if I have trouble, but I am trying to be reasonably self-sufficient.\nDan Robertson\nSouth Gate, Maryland\nDear Dan,\nCongrats on the new boat. I know the First 456 well, and have found it to be a capable, powerful and fast cruiser. I recommend approaching this first passage with a conservative approach. The safety of your crew is paramount, and you want to get the boat where it needs to be.\nFirst, make sure you are equipped with the required safety gear. In the excitement of a new boat, it can be easy to overlook life jackets (including a throwable), flares, sound-making devices and more.\nNext, I inspect and familiarize myself with the critical systems before leaving the dock:\n\u2022 Identify all the through-hull fittings and locate emergency wooden plugs.\n\u2022 Inspect the rig and all the fittings.\n\u2022 Inspect the steering system; a boat that can\u2019t steer is vulnerable.\n\u2022 Inspect the engine.\nWith assurance that the basics look good, I want to be prepared for any problems. When boats change hands there is often a period of layup or at least lack of use. This passive time can be hard on fuel and water can build up in the tank leading to organic growth. I carry several spare fuel filters, typically Racor 500 series cartridges. Three or four cartridges are likely enough to get you through or at least give you time to get more if you start to clog filters.\nBe prepared with the tools and skills to bleed your new engine, should you need to. Alternator drive belts can be a problem,\u00a0 so carry at least one spare belt and the tools to change it.\nGetting away from the dock is always tough; there is always one more thing, and there is never enough time. If you can, plan a short leg on the first day, and then take some solid time to rest and prepare for the real passage.\nOverall, enjoy yourself. Be mentally prepared for some things not to work, and know in many cases, it is due to user error. Have the previous owner on speed dial for questions. Figuring out the boat is all part of the fun. To quote John Kretschmer, if things don\u2019t work, figure out why you didn\u2019t need them in the first place.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Boat Doctor\nTake care of your prop and it will take care of you\nHow do I connect solar panels?\nShould I ditch the hanks for a roller furler?\nCan I drop in lithium batteries?\nWhy won\u2019t my holding tank pump out?\nWhich way is better: Erie Canal or  the St. Lawrence?\nHow do I keep my A-sail under control?\nHow do I replace leaking hatches?\nHow do I stop my mast from leaking?\nHow should I rig a preventer?\nAlso from Bob Pingel\nTake care of your prop and it will take care of you\nDiesel engine care\nHow do I connect solar panels?\nOptimizing shore power\nShould I ditch the hanks for a roller furler?\nCan I drop in lithium batteries?\nWhy won\u2019t my holding tank pump out?\nWhich way is better: Erie Canal or  the St. Lawrence?\nHow do I keep my A-sail under control?\nThe knots you need to know\nSubscribe\nFollow Us\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to get the latest from SAILING Magazine delivered via email.\nEmail Address\n*\nEmail Format\nhtml\ntext\n*\nindicates required\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nPowered by\nWEHAA.COM\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Sailing Magazine, All rights reserved.\nClose\nClose\nClose",

Both Alerion and Sanford\u2019s subsequent version served as inspiration for what is today the Alerion Express 28.\nIn the 1980s, Connecticut businessman and sailor Ralph Schacter commissioned West Coast designer Carl Schumacher to draw a boat with traditional beauty that also had unrivaled performance capabilities, yet would be easy to singlehand.\n\u201cRalph supposedly said, \u2018I want a boat I can sail with my dog.\u2019 Apparently his wife was no longer interested in sailing but Schacter wanted to bring his dog along so the boat had to be easy to singlehand,\u201d said Ralf Morgan, who sails his\u00a0 AE 28 Ditzy on San Francisco Bay\nSchumacher, who also designed the Alerion 20 and 38, drew plans for a simply rigged daysailer that included an engine, and features a spartan interior with a head and a couple of bunks. Hull No. 1 was a prototype built at Lost River Marine in Stuart, Florida, in 1989. With Schumacher\u2019s\u00a0 AE 28 drawings in hand, Schacter partnered with Holby Marine, then run by W. Barrett Holby Jr. in Bristol, Rhode Island. Holby Marine built seven more hulls.\nDespite its classic looks above the surface, the\u00a0 AE 28 has a semi-elliptical keel and spade rudder. Schumacher designed two different keels, a standard fin or the Scheel, the latter ending in a semi-elliptical bulb and flat bottom.\nLater hulls were built by Tillotson-Pearson Inc., and the design and construction remained unchanged at TPI through Hull No. 150, when minor modifications to the cockpit were made and some deck hardware beefed up. TPI also increased the ballast to make the boat less tender.\nBy 1994, designer Garry Hoyt had become involved in the production, replacing the original self-tacking jib with his Hoyt Jib Boom.\nConstruction\nThe balsa-core-sandwich hull and decks, are prone to attracting moisture and eventually delamination. The hull and deck, like most yachts built by TPI at that time, were bonded together with bullet-proof adhesives like Plexus MA550 along a flange where the two parts meet. The hull and deck were not through-bolted, but that has not proved a problem.\nAE 28 decks are vacuum-bagged end-grain balsa covered with unidirectional and bidirectional fiberglass that is custom formulated by TPI. A layer of vinylester resin was applied to prevent osmotic blistering. (TPI, now under the aegis of USWatercraft, offered a 10-year limited warranty against blistering). The Hall spar is keel stepped, taking up room in the small cabin but adding to the vessel\u2019s overall strength and stability. TPI reinforced the maststep with additional fiberglass. The rudder is made of carbon stock, and the post fitted with Rulon bearings.\nWhat to look for\nMarine surveyors advise potential buyers to have the hull and deck carefully inspected by a knowledgeable expert using a moisture meter and other tools to determine if damage is present. On certain models the gelcoat is prone to crazing both on the topsides and at stress points on deck.\nLater models featured larger-diameter scuppers for the self-bailing cockpits. Some owners have had to replace original Delron bushings on the rudderpost. Others have experienced delaminated tillers, which were originally glued and are now epoxied. Original No. 7 Lewmar cabintop winches were somewhat wimpy and often were replaced with No. 14s, making it easier for the less muscular crew to trim sail.\nSuggested upgrades also include adding double purchase to the outhaul on the main and rerouting the backstay and traveler control lines under the deck to the barney post where they can be more easily reached.\nAE 28s built before 1994 will likely have the original self-tacking jib. Converting to a Hoyt Jib Boom could cost upwards of $12,000.\nOn deck\nThe deck layout is simple. There are no lifelines to interfere with the boat\u2019s lines. The teak tiller can be easily reached in the spacious, nine-foot cockpit. Potential buyers should keep in mind the\u00a0 AE 28 has relatively low freeboard and that can mean a wet boat, so blustery days may require foul-weather gear. The Harken 4-to-1 traveler is located aft of the tiller, making it difficult to access and control, but the lines can be rerouted to the barney post.\nThe\u00a0 AE 28 has quality deck hardware, including Lewmar self-tailing winches, and Harken roller furler and mainsheet controls. Some owners have upgraded the winch sizes. The standing rigging is 1x19 stainless wire with open-barrel turnbuckles. Deck equipment includes lazy jacks, a Hall Quick Vang system, adjustable backstay, a Lewmar smoke-tinted deck hatch and four iconic fixed elliptical Bomar portlights. The grab rails on the companionway, the toerail and coaming trim are teak. The companionway hatch slider is Lexan, as is the drop-in washboard.\nDown below\nThere isn\u2019t a whole lot to celebrate below deck in the\u00a0 AE 28 but what\u2019s there is intelligently designed and made from high-quality materials. The saloon is narrow, and standing room is about 5 feet 8 inches. But the surroundings are comfortable, with a teak-and-holly sole, and the bulkheads of solid exotic woods rather than laminates. There\u2019s a small sink with a manual pump and a built-in cooler at the foot of the companionway. Some boats rely on portable toilets while others have a head with holding tank or bag.\nEngine\nDepending on the year and availability, the\u00a0 AE 28 relies on a Yanmar 1GM 10 diesel engine or a Volvo Saildrive. Earlier models had a single-cylinder diesel propeller-and-shaft engine that required a stuffing box. Later models featured a 14-horsepower, two-cylinder Yanmar 2GM14 saildrive. Two removable panels provide engine access. Alerion recently began offering an electric engine.\nUnderway\nJack Detweiler, who races his 2001\u00a0 AE 28 Skimmer on Chesapeake Bay, said the boat is easy to sail and handles well in most wind conditions. \u201cThe harder it blows, the better this boat sails,\u201d he said.\nDetweiler bought his\u00a0 AE 28 six years ago and has since switched from a full-batten main to partial battens to accommodate the Chesapeake Bay\u2019s light air.\nThe\u00a0 AE 28 running rigging is installed where it\u2019s easy to reach so that the boat can be singlehanded. Although the self-tacking headsail offers limited control of the foresail shape, many shorthanded sailors appreciate the convenience. The yacht\u2019s low coachroof makes it easier to see what\u2019s ahead.\n\u201cThe\u00a0 AE 28 is a great, one-design boat that sails easily with a crew of two. My wife and I sail together all the time. It\u2019s very stable and can hold its own in PHRF and one-design. I have sail in up to 32 knots of breeze with no reef,\u201d said Morgan, adding that sailing the\u00a0 AE 28 effectively is all about controlling the backstay tension.\nAs for the Hoyt Jib Boom, it doesn\u2019t allow sailing wing on wing because it swings to center, according to Morgan, who has created a gas spring that pushes the boom outward. \u201cIt creates positive back pressure, keeping the boom extended out so that you can sail wing on wing,\u201d he said.\nConclusion\nNo matter whether she\u2019s called the gentlemen\u2019s daysailer, the rich man\u2019s round-the-cans sloop or the prettiest girl at the dance, the Alerion Express 28 continues to increase its popularity as one-design\u00a0 fleets grow on both coasts in the United States and on the Great Lakes. With such good looks and fast maneuvering, it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s still the talk of the dock after\n25 years.\nLOA\u00a0 28\u20193\u201d;\u00a0LWL\u00a0 22\u201910\u201d;\u00a0Beam\u00a0 8\u20192\u201d;\u00a0Draft\u00a0 4\u20196\u201d;\u00a0Displ. 5,700 lb.;\u00a0Ballast 2,200 lb.;\u00a0Sail area 352 sq. ft.\nSAILING\u2019s Value Guide\nPRICE:\u00a0 An Alerion Express 28 built prior to 2006 can be typically purchased for less than $75,000. Asking prices ranged from a high of $105,000 for a 2009 model, to a low of $52,900 for one built in 2003, both in Connecticut.\nDESIGN QUALITY:\u00a0 Designed by Carl Schumacher, the concept appeals to traditionalist sailors, but with a modern underbody. Lightweight composites coupled with a spade rudder and Scheel keel enable the\u00a0 AE 28 with nimble handling characteristics and surprising performance.\nCONSTRUCTION QUALITY: The sturdy hull structure features keel floors, keel sump, engine bed, maststep and longitudinal stringers molded integrally with the hull during the SCRIMP process. The deck is similarly resin-infused SCRIMP GRP with a balsa core. All bulkheads are marine grade plywood bonded to the hull and deck.\nUSER-FRIENDLINESS:\u00a0 The Alerion is comfortable on deck, particularly in the cockpit. The mainsheet is fitted to a barney post. The self-tacker on earlier models and the Hoyt Jib Boom on boats built after 1994 make tacking simple. Lazy jacks make it easy to lower the mainsail.\nSAFETY:\u00a0 Advocates of the design contend its Yanmar diesel has plenty of power, while its heavy keel ensures the hull remains upright\u00a0 under sail. The absence of lifelines is a bone of contention for some safety-minded sailors. The self-draining cockpit is a plus. There\u2019s also a manually-operated bilge pump in the cockpit.\nTYPICAL CONDITION:\u00a0 As most brokers will attest, the average Alerion owner takes pride in this head turner, which suggests lack of maintenance is seldom an issue.\nREFITTING:\u00a0 Several\u00a0 AE 28 sailors added a light-air jib boom extender, reinstall and caulk the fixed portlights, and made two of the portals able to open for ventilation. Adding a Hoyt Jib Boom to an early model\u00a0 AE 28 can be costly.\nSUPPORT: Alerion became part of US Watercraft last year. Owners can contact Alerion Yachts, 373 Market St., Warren, RI, 02885, 401-247-3000. Five active Alerion one-design fleets can be found from San Francisco to Chesapeake Bay, each with its own info-packed website.\nAVAILABILITY: There are an estimated 450\u00a0 AE 28s sailing throughout the world. More than a dozen\u00a0 AE 28s are typically on the used-boat market in the United States.\nINVESTMENT AND RESALE:\u00a0 A new\u00a0 AE 28 costs approximately $130,000, a used 10-year-old model in good condition can still fetch $80,000.\nComments\n|\nShare your opinion\n|\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by Disqus.\ncomments powered by\nDisqus\nAlso in Used Boat Notebook\nBeneteau 393\nC&C 37/40\nCabo Rico 38\nHunter Vision 32\nC&C 34+\nHunter Passage 42\nPearson Rhodes 41\nCabot 36\nGozzard 44\nSanta Cruz 52\nAlso from David Liscio\nBuilding a dream\nBeneteau 393\nC&C 37/40\nRig tuning\nHow to optimize for shorthanded sailing\nCabo Rico 38\nBargin Boats to Sail Now\nHunter Vision 32\nChasing a dream\nThe wide, wide world of multihulls\nSubscribe\nFollow Us\nNewsletter\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to get the latest from SAILING Magazine delivered via email.\nEmail Address\n*\nEmail Format\nhtml\ntext\n*\nindicates required\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nPowered by\nWEHAA.COM\nCopyright \u00a9 2026 Sailing Magazine, All rights reserved.\nClose\nClose\nClose",

(Please note: Current US Sailing membership is required.)\nCertified US Sailing instructors\nCollegiate sailing athletes\nMembers of US Olympic Sailing Team\nProfessional crew/captains\nPaid race yachts crew\nInternational cruisers\nWhat if I am a US Sailing member, but I do not fit neatly into one of these categories?\nPlease contact Rick Bagnall at\nrbagnall@risk-strategies.com\nor 860.399.3634 to discuss\nDoes this policy offer coverage inside the United States, for the time periods when I am not abroad or offshore?\nYes, the policy offers coverage in the United States, using the Anthem network.\nWhen can I enroll?\nThis is an annual insurance policy. US Sailing members can enroll in this program during Open Enrollment which runs from July 1st to August 31st. The policy period starts September 1st.\nAfter Open Enrollment, enrollment is closed unless the US Sailing member has a qualifying event.\nCan I enroll online?\nOnline enrollment is available only during the Open Enrollment period which runs from July 1st to August 31st. To enroll at other times, contact Rick Bagnall at\nrbagnall@risk-strategies.com\nor 860.399.3634. Please note that premiums are payable by credit card only.\nWhy are the premiums so low in the US Sailing Group crew medical program?\nSeveral factors contribute to the low premiums in this program.\nMany people covered in the program spend time outside of the United States for much of the year, and health insurance coverage is a lot less expensive overseas.\nMany in the program have multiple sources of coverage (eg, paid crew typically have P&I from the vessel), thus the full exposure to risk is lower.\nWithin US Sailing\u2019s membership base, the majority that qualifies for this coverage tend to be younger.\nWhat is a qualifying event?\nBenefit plans can be affected by life event changes, some of which qualify as an official change in status by the IRS. Generally, when you enroll in benefits as a new employee, you cannot make any changes until the next Open Enrollment period. However, if you experience a qualified change in status you can make mid-year changes. A qualifying event, also called a life event change, is a personal change in status which may allow you to change your benefit elections. Examples of some qualifying events include, but are not limited to, the following:\nChange in legal marital status \u2013 marriage, divorce, legal separation, annulment, death of a spouse.\nChange in number of dependents \u2013 birth, death, adoption, placement for adoption, award of legal guardianship.\nChange in employment status of the employee\u2019s spouse or employee\u2019s dependent \u2013 switching from part-time to full-time employment status or from full-time to part-time, termination or commencement of employment, a strike or lockout, commencement of or return from an unpaid leave of absence which results in employee/dependent becoming ineligible for coverage.\nDependent satisfies or ceases to satisfy eligibility requirement \u2013 marriage of a dependent or change in student status.\nHow do I enroll if I have a qualifying event?\nIt is important to remember that if you experience a qualifying event, you will need to request a change to your benefits within 30 calendar days of the event and provide required documentation. If you do not request the change within 30 calendar days, the next opportunity you will have to make changes to your benefits will be during the next Open Enrollment period.\nWhat if my US physician or hospital is not listed in Geo Blue\u2019s online provider network?\nThe next step would be to call your Physician or Hospital directly and see if they are in the Anthem network. If they are in the Anthem network they should accept Geo Blue.\nCan this insurance be offered as a group benefit to a team or group of sailors?\nYes. We can set up a group contract and supply a statement directly to your business. This allows employees the extra benefit of paying their premium through payroll deduction and receiving their benefits as a pre-tax benefit. In order to set up a group contract, please contact Rick Bagnall at\nrbagnall@risk-strategies.com\nor 860.399.3634\nWho is the insurance carrier for this program?\nGeo Blue is the carrier for the US Sailing group crew medical program.

In the United States, Geo Blue uses the Anthem physician and hospital network.\nWhat is Risk Strategies/Gowrie Group's role in the US Sailing health insurance plan?\nRisk Strategies/Gowrie Group is US Sailing\u2019s insurance partner and manages this health insurance program.

For years now, I\u2019ve been topping off my tanks when fall lay-up comes around in order to reduce the air space above the fuel and thus minimize algae growth. Just\nAluminum in engine oil\nFebruary 1, 2011\nQuestion: I just did my first oil analysis on my Cummins 6BTA diesel, and the results seem somewhat disconcerting. According to the report, there was aluminum in the oil at 28 ppm (parts per million) and iron at 20 ppm. The oil that was tested had approximately 43 engine hours on it. And since I bought my boat some nine years ago, I have\nCaterpillar 3208 low rpm\nJanuary 1, 2011\nQuestion: I have a 1989 Sea Ray with 375-hp Caterpillar 3208 diesels. Last year I overheated one of them and blew a head gasket. Overheating had been a problem for some time prior, incidentally. Anyway, I determined shortly thereafter that the gasket had blown into the cylinder although no cooling fluid had escaped. So I hired a diesel shop to\nOnan genset spewing black smoke\nDecember 1, 2010\nQuestion: I have a 4-kW Marine Onan genset with 600 hours on it. If I let it run for a lengthy period it produces so much black smoke that a residue discolors the hull around the exhaust port. A year ago, I cleaned the heat exchanger and installed a new raw-water pump. There are no overheating issues. Do I have an injector or rack problem?\u2014Charlie Carpenter, Morristown, New\nNoisy Engines\nNovember 1, 2010\nQuestion: I have a pair of Detroit Diesel 6-71 TIBs in my 1990 Ocean 48 Super Sport. I love both the boat and the motors, but the Detroits have always been loud at the exhaust end of things. As I grow older, this noise is starting to bother me, particularly at times when I have to shout to be heard on the flying bridge at cruise speed.

As I go from cruise to wide-open throttle (approximately 23 mph at 2800 rpm), turbo exhaust temperatures increase from 700F to 950F on the port engine and 850F on the starboard. When\nCan switching motor oil viscosity harm my engine?\nQuestion: The boys at the Ko Olina harbor are having a heated discussion concerning motor oil. Since Costco hit town, we\u2019ve all been able to buy Chevron 15W-40 Delo 400 heavy-duty motor oil at ridiculously low prices. But what about the older engines we\u2019ve been using straight 40W Delo 400 and other single-viscosity products in for years? Can we\nUsing synthetic oils in older engines\nQuestion: I own a 1996 43-foot Hatteras with twin six-cylinder Detroit Diesel engines. I change the oil approximately every 100 hours of operation. At this point, I have 1,200 hours on each diesel and so far have only used non-synthetic oil.

During operation, the temperature of each engine rises normally at first but then keeps on going, not to the point of setting off alarms, but close.

Credit: Adobe Stock\nAerial view of the tranquil Kioni on the Greek Ionian island of Ithaca\nCharter skipper Tom Fletcher gives you a guided tour of his favourite Ionian island of Ithaca, home of the mythical hero Odysseus.\nNestled in the sapphire\nIonian Sea\n, Ithaca is my favourite island in the southern Ionian. Without an international airport, it remains untouched by mass tourism, preserving an authentic atmosphere. Woven into the fabric of Homeric legend is more than just the fabled home of Odysseus \u2013 Ithaca is a place where magic and reality are hard to separate. In summer, as the sun blazes overhead and cicadas fill the olive groves, time stands still in the anchorages.\nAs you sail around headlands, bay after bay appears, inviting you to drop anchor and never leave. Rocky hills with trails through pine forests to ancient ruins offer glimpses into a landscape that has inspired poets and adventurers for centuries. Ithaca offers some of the best anchorages and harbours in the Ionian.\nThe North\nApproaching from Sail Ionian\u2019s base on Lefkada, the first you see of legendary Ithaca is the rugged vertical cliffs of Afales Bay. While the water is such an inviting turquoise colour, we often caution charter guests about this area. There are some wonderful, secluded beaches, but underwater rocks lurk waiting to surprise unsuspecting charterers. The bay also offers no shelter once the predominant northwesterly winds start to blow, leaving a yacht on a rocky lee shore with swell coming in. On a calm morning, it can be a great place for a quick dip, but I rarely linger.\nThe Northeast\nThe stretch of coast from Afales in the north to Vathi in the south is probably the busiest section of Ithaca. It encompasses some lovely anchorages and the popular harbours of Frikes and Kioni. This area is known for its afternoon gusts and katabatic winds and the many ruined windmills on the headlands bear witness to this!\nMy first stop when coming from Lefkada is often in Marmagkas Bay. This sheltered beach is protected by reef around the tiny island chapel of St Nikolaos which guards the entrance and provides some of the best snorkelling on Ithaca. It can be very gusty on an afternoon here \u2013 long line from the beach to put your stern into the wind if you\u2019re staying all day.\nFrikes is the first port you will come to, and the bays along the entrance to the north and south make nice anchorages, though they can get busy with flotillas. Frikes itself, unfortunately, suffers from ferry swell, which builds as it enters the narrowing bay and can cause damage to yachts on the exposed quay. Most boats choose to raft up behind the breakwater on the southern side of the harbour. I\u2019m not really a fan of this as you have people walking all over your yacht all night. The village itself is pleasant though, and there are some good restaurants on the quay.\nIt is Kioni, though, that is the jewel of the northeast coast. Possibly the most beautiful harbour in the Ionian with three ruined windmills guarding the entrance. I have a soft spot for Kioni despite its challenging mooring situation. The quayside is usually full by early afternoon, though getting there on a Monday should beat the flotillas. I always used to try to arrive around 5pm, just as the last tour boat was vacating a space. When timed right, you could avoid the mess of long-lined boats on the southern shore and moor stern-to on the outside of the mole. It\u2019s deep and rocky where you drop, but I\u2019ve never had an issue; you just need to be quick getting your first stern line on, as the wind is usually behind you blowing you off, and there isn\u2019t much space.\nKioni seems to glow at golden hour, and as the sun sets, katabatic gusts funnel down the valley cooling the heat from the day. The village is stunning, and the pretty handmade jewellery shop in an old house is ideal for a sparkly souvenir and very popular with our guests. There are excellent dining options, including one restaurant in a building at the end of the quay that was built for Elizabeth Hamilton, niece of Lord Nelson! After dinner, don\u2019t miss the quirky jazz bar for a late-night cocktail.\nGreece ithaki island, panoramic view of the sea by the main harbor of ithaka island\nCruising Ithaca: Vathi\nThe entrance into Ithaca\u2019s capital is long and fjord-like, with awesome steep hills. It makes for a beautiful view but can funnel a strong northwesterly into the harbour, and results in Vathi being untenable on occasional summer evenings.\nApproaching the main town, you first pass a quay on the northeast shore. This is a sheltered location, a 5-10 minute walk from the town, and it is popular with the flotillas due to its lone taverna. Mooring here is the best bet when the northwest wind is strong.\nPassing the Lazareto island, the large main town quay comes into view. Vathi is a busy little town, great for provisioning, and my favourite place to be when the wind blows from the south and brings rain in the shoulder season. In the peak summer months, it can be a little noisy, but the buzz of a town is fun after a string of quiet anchorages. Look for the quaint back street \u2018Douriou Ippou\u2019 with some nice boutiques and a really good restaurant on a corner. The promenade around the sea front is a pretty walk too, passing the Drakoulis mansion on the way to the small Archaeology Museum. Take a seat in the square in the early evening and enjoy watching the world go by, and, if you have youth on your side, the late-night bars on the eastern shore are worth a visit after dinner.\nCruising Ithaca: The Southeast\nOnce south of Vathi, the wind generally calms and afternoons can be long, still and hot, filled with the sound of cicadas. This stretch of coast has some amazing anchorages, and I always advise Sail Ionian\u2019s guests to take some time and explore it.\nGidaki beach is the first anchorage you will see, a distinctive beach split in half by a landslide with inviting turquoise water and a beach bar. It\u2019s a lovely swim stop after leaving Vathi, but tends to fill up in the afternoons and can get very busy.\nJust south of Gidaki is Filatrou, which is one of my favourites. The bay has two sides, the southern beach with swimming buoys is backed by olive groves that hide a cool beach bar serving great food, while the northern cliff-backed beach is a beautiful anchorage.\nAround the headland is hidden Sarakiniko, another pretty pebbly beach with lovely water fringed by olives trees hiding its own simple beach bar.\nSouth again is Pera Pigadi, just that bit further than many charter yachts venture. The sea around this tiny island is often flat calm on an afternoon. There\u2019s a 4m deep channel to anchor in, with more anchorages near the little beaches just to the south. Pera Pigadi has crystal-clear water and, in the hills above the bay, the Spring of Arethusa, mentioned in Homers \u2018Iliad\u2019. I often spend the night here and cook on board as it\u2019s peaceful even in the peak summer months.\nRounding the south of Ithaca, the anchorages begin to peter out. The last one is Agios Andreou, a steep ravine and very deep, but it can be an attractive option if you want to get away from people.\nCruising Ithaca: The West\nAnchorages are few and far between on the west coast, and there are no harbours to speak of except for the small ferry landing at Aetos where a boat comes from Kefalonia. There are some small coves which can be lovely for the brave long liner but nothing big enough to accommodate a few boats apart from Aetos Bay.\nYou must go all the way to the northwest to find Polis, facing Fiscardo. Many yachts long line on the northwest shore but, if you are just outside the swimming buoys, you can swing on the anchor in between 5-10m of water off the beach. The bay has a mysterious past \u2013 the name means \u2018city\u2019 in Greek \u2013 and, though there is no village here, there are ruins in the terraced olive trees west of the beach. Bronze Age golden sculptures were found in a cave on the north shore and an ancient chapel is half buried in the hillside near the fishing harbour. A 20-minute walk up the hill brings you to the village of Stavros, with its lovely square, tavernas, and exhibit about Odysseus. Sandy near the beach, but with thick weed in places, have a look in the water from the bow and drop in a lighter patch where you see sand. Polis is sheltered by steep hillsides all around and on a settled day the wind does lazy circles around the bay. Avoid if strong winds are forecast \u2013 the wind has a nasty habit of accelerating down the hillside and it can blow a hoolie if you\u2019re here on the wrong night. I\u2019ve had to leave in the middle of the night before and many friends have similar stories!\ndefault\nWalk 20 minutes up the hill for dinner in the village of Stavros. Trust me, it\u2019s worth it for the pretty square and great grill house (there\u2019s a hotel with a pool bar halfway up if you need a rest). In the centre of the village is a display and a reconstruction of the ruins of a Bronze Age palace complex found nearby. It is believed to have been Odysseus\u2019 home and can be visited by taxi, though little remains to the untrained eye apart from some monumental stone foundations. Recent excavations have rekindled interest in this site and discovered evidence of pilgrimages and cult worship in antiquity, showing Odysseus\u2019 enduring allure. If you go up to see the ruins of the Bronze Age complex, visit the nearby village of Exogi for lunch with a spectacular view over Afales Bay, as I\u2019m sure Odysseus himself did.\nSailing around Ithaca offers a blend of beautiful harbour towns and secluded coves, making it a favourite among Ionian sailors seeking a relaxed pace. Many anchorages feature clear waters, scenic beaches, and easy access to traditional villages, but depths can be significant, often requiring substantial lengths of anchor chain, and early evenings can be windy, so caution is needed. The culture and history of the islands shines through, putting it at the top of the list to me.\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Destinations\nIonian Sailing in Autumn: Guide to Exploring Greek Islands in the Off-Season\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nPremier Falmouth Marina: Guide and Cruising Grounds\nSailing in Corsica, Sardinia & Sicily: Mediterranean Chartering\nChartering in Spain: Guide to Spanish Coast & Balearic Island\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Unlike so many before him, Beaumont actually made it work and the result is a niche brand of highly innovative boats tailored for blue water cruising and designed by Kiwi Kevin Dibley. The 44 is the latest addition and the smallest boat in the range so far. She retains all the key features through including a centre cockpit set up, skeg hung rudder and innovative Z Keel bolting system which is viewed as pretty bulletproof. If you\u2019re after a serious blue water cruiser, this could be the boat for you.\nKraken 44\nkrakenyachts.com\nWindelo 62\nFrench manufacturer Windelo has carved a niche for itself by producing fast cruising catamarans that offer a high level of sustainability due to innovative basalt construction married to electric hybrid motor set ups and sustainably sourced materials for decking and interior fit out. The company has flourished since its launch in 2016 and their new 62 is a sign of the ambition of the boatbuilder. This is their biggest yacht to date and it has the same sustainable features as the smaller boats just on a larger scale. This is definitely a performance cruiser, featuring daggerboards and a powerful rig, but the boat is also set up to be sailed easily by a couple \u2013 although understandably given the size of this boat, there is a skipper\u2019s cabin. The interior design by Stellantis also looks suitably slick.\nWindelo 62\nwindelo-catamaran.com\nDivinite 7m\nThe Divinite 7 is the brainchild of Eric Henseval, a naval architect who has conceived the boat as a fast cruiser/expedition boat that can be home built. According to Henseval, there are already two models being built in Europe. Ease of construction is key and the epoxy/ply is the favoured materiel, although it could also be built in either GRP or aluminium. The boat features a relatively powerful rig and twin rudders married to a twin lifting keel set u that would allow the boat to dry out in shallow harbours. The full scow bow boosts internal volume to make the boat more comfortable than you\u2019d expect a 21\u2019 yacht to be.\nhensevalyachtdesign.jimdofree.com\nDivinite 7m\nJ Boats J/7\nWhat seems like many centuries ago, J Boats built the first J/24 and, in doing so, the company hit the big time. Back then performance day sailers were big business. It\u2019s not so much the case these days, with most boatbuilders shying away from building uncomplicated entry level yachts like this, so hats off to J Boats for going back to their roots with the J/7. The boat is clearly going to be quite quick but is also easy to handle and features a big cockpit with a small enclosed \u2018cabin\u2019 forward which is exclusively for storage unless you are a true masochist. The boat has a generous sail area but a deep keel and decent beam suggest a stiff boat that is fun and easy to handle.\nJ Boats J/7\nJboats.com\nY Yachts Y6\nBoatbuilder and general maverick Michael Schmidt is best known for setting up Hanse Yachts back in the day but, once he sold off that business, he found himself at a loose and and set up Y Yachts, a luxury boatbuilder specialising in lightweight, carbon fibre semi custom semi-superyachts. The Y6 is of more interest to us because this is the smallest boat in the range so far at 64\u2019, opening the market out to a far broader audience. This Bill Tripp design retains the sleek lines and uncluttered decks of its larger sisters and the blend of luxury and performance makes this an intriguing proposition. Y Yachts maintain that this is a boat that is easily handled by a small crew and a full time skipper is not necessary.\nY Yachts Y6\nyyachts.de\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from New Boats\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nRaising Children on a Boat: How a Life Under Sail Shapes Our Kids\nTop New Sailing Boats on Market: Fresh Yacht Designs and Latest Launches\nSaare 41.2 Boat Test: New Estonian Cruising Yacht\nGrand Soleil Blue Boat Test: The New Slick Performance Dayboat\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Conversations, as usual, started off on a fairly high plane of adventure on the high seas, but quickly descended into wailing over marina prices, cost of diesel, harbour master grumbles, and anything else which breathes a whiff of sadness into the souls of anyone who owns a boat. So, hoping for more uplifting conversation I turned to the woman on my right and said, \u201cI go cruising, what do you do?\u201d Such a banal question I hoped she might change places. What she came back with nearly had me off my seat.\n\u201cI ADORE cruising,\u201d she declared. \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a GORGEOUS experience.\u201d I\u2019ve heard it described many ways but never quite as enthusiastically as that, often quite the reverse. But here was a woman so taken with our sport that she looked as though she was about to break into an operatic appreciation. The prospects for the rest of the evening rose dramatically.\nIt was about 15 minutes later that I managed to piece together a rather perplexing jigsaw, for she had indeed made some noteworthy voyages with talk of Pacific anchorages, ocean crossings as well as a bit a bit of high latitudes stuff, even though she wasn\u2019t at all worried about the price of diesel.\nYou will have guessed by now that her vessel of choice was over a thousand tons with a dozen restaurants and not a hand-pumped lavatory in sight. Once I made it clear there was nobody on my vessel to turn down my bed, or leave a chocolate mint on the pillow, we had a laugh.\nAnd where do I find myself right now? On a\ncruise ship\n. Me! After all these years of somewhat despising them. However, I have chosen a four-masted barquentine where crew do the hard work and I enjoy three hot meals a day and none of them out of a Fray Bentos tin, so I haven\u2019t completely swallowed my principles. It is still sailing, as well as quite a learning experience.\nTake the first thing that happened after we\u2019d stepped aboard \u2013 the\nsafety\nbriefing. There were three of them; one now, another in a couple of hours time, and a further one the following morning in case we\u2019d forgotten the first two. I realised to my shame that I have become woefully inadequate when it comes to these important matters. Certainly I make sure everyone has\nlifejacket\nand wears it, but by the time I tell my crew where the flares are I am fast running out of steam. \u2018The flares are in a yellow canister in the aft locker,\u2019 I will intone in great seriousness, before being interrupted by a cry from below, \u2018No! We moved them to the ropes locker, to make room for\u2026.\u2019 \u2018But I moved them back\u2019 I declare as I fling open the locker before closing it quickly when it appears I haven\u2019t moved them back at all.\nI was once moored next to a decent sized charter boat where the skipper elevated the safety briefing to new heights. His customers arrived in the afternoon, one by one. Introductions took place, somewhat uncomfortably, and then he launched into his epic speech on safety. I went below, had something to eat, did a bit of route planning, read the newspaper, and came up to find him still at it an hour and a half later, his fare-paying customers sitting with a glazed looks in their eyes wondering why they ever signed up to this punishment. I later learned that the skipper had retired from safety officer duties on North Sea oil rigs and this was his new career and thoroughness was his religion. I also learned later that his unique selling point was that his cruises were targeted at \u2018Singles\u2019 \u2013 solo travellers, some of them seeking romance. If there was anything better designed to dampen a romantic atmosphere, it was his fifteen minute lecture on \u2018avoiding burns\u2019. I didn\u2019t see the look of newly-found love flickering across any faces as they trudged ashore, in complete safety of course.\nLooking for further inspiration as to what might improve my own crew\u2019s experience and get me some of those highly valued stars on Trustpilot, I glanced down the list of offered activities on the ship I was on. Should I opt for Water Gymnastics with Samuel or cocktail mixing on the Tropical Deck? Guess.\nAnd then I found Walk a Mile with a Smile. You stagger round the ship as many times as it takes to clock up a mile. I\u2019ve done a calculation. On my boat, at 40ft long, one circuit takes 80ft which is 0.015 of a mile. That means 70 circuits grinning as you go! No stopping for romance. though.\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Cruising Stories\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\nHow to Sail the French Riviera on a Budget: Navigating Billionaire\u2019s Alley by Boat\nSailing Novels & Guides: How Sailors Use Marina Book Exchanges to Stay Stocked\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

The ideal time to visit is between December and April, which is comfortably outside the hurricane season.\nThanks to the Caribbean\u2019s popularity for on-the-water holidays, it is home to a wide variety of charter options, including flotilla adventures, skippered, and bareboat charters. Companies like Nautilus which covers destinations such as British Virgin Islands (BVIs), Antigua, Grenada and St Vincent, St Lucia, Martinique, St Martin, Guadeloupe, Bahamas, Belize, also offer last minute bookings, which is a good incentive if you have the opportunity to just \u2018book and go\u2019.\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide  |  Photo credit: Shutterstock\nJonathan Shears \u2013 Managing Director at\nNautilus\n\u2013 was keen to offer a few booking tips: \u201cWhile we offer last minute bookings, the majority of Caribbean bookings come in 11 months before departure which coincides with the flights being released. If you are not fixed to school holidays then a sweet spot is the month of January when the weather and winds are great but the availability and prices are good.\u201d\nLike Nautilus,\nPlain Sailing\n\u2019s Co-Founder Adi Tognarelli, says bookings in this part of the world are on the rise: \u201cThe Caribbean season already looks to be one of the biggest, with record numbers of new catamarans out on the waters around our bases \u2013 from Antigua and Barbuda through to the BVI, Bahamas and the Grenadines.\u201d\nCommenting on the types of charter that are particularly popular, Tognarelli added: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased interest for more \u2018off-the-beaten\u2019 track destinations like Gaudeloupe and Martinique, which can be difficult to get to but sailors are rewarded with perfect sailing conditions, wall-to-wall sunshine, and some incredible views.\u201d\nAnd the popular holiday periods? Tognarelli concluded: \u201cChristmas and New Year continue to dominate, with many of our charter partners already fully booked, even at the incredibly expensive peak-peak prices. Look for charters in April and May for the best bang for your buck \u2013 still great conditions for sailing in.\u201d\nThe other main reason the Caribbean has grown in popularity over the past couple of decades is its relative ease of access. Islands like Antigua, Grenada, and St Lucia are served by regular non-stop flights from the UK, typically taking just 8 to 10 hours. Even destinations that require a connection, such as the British Virgin Islands, US Virgin Islands, or St Martin, are still reachable within a total travel time of around 12 to 14 hours.\nCaribbean charter  |  Photo credit: Sunsail\nSunsail\n, which operates from a selection of bases in the Caribbean including the British Virgin Islands, St Lucia, Grenada, Antigua, Bahamas, Belize, St Martin, and Martinique is a popular choice for charter. Like most other companies, Sunsail\u2019s UK/ZA/AU Marketing Manager Caroline Barbour says the Caribbean is the go-to winter charter with customers booking well in advance: \u201cThis winter, we\u2019ve seen an increase in bookings, largely due to shifting customer behaviour over the past year. Unlike the typical shorter booking window, many clients are now securing their charters further in advance. We attribute this to a strong volume of repeat bookings, with guests eager to reserve their preferred yachts early to avoid disappointment. Additionally, the continued resurgence of the BVIs following Hurricane Irma has contributed to steady growth in demand for this destination in particular.\u201d\nMost companies offer a choice of charter options with bareboat chartering remaining popular, especially for families and groups who want the freedom to sail independently. For those with less experience \u2013 or without the required skipper qualifications \u2013 a skippered charter (with a qualified skipper onboard) is a great alternative, offering a stress-free holiday with the added bonus of learning the ropes from a professional at sea.\nFor solo travellers, couples, or friends seeking the freedom of the open ocean and the excitement of a sailing holiday without the responsibility of being in charge of the yacht, \u2018By the Cabin\u2019 charters offer the perfect solution. Available in certain destinations from companies like Sunsail,\nThe Moorings\n, and\nDream Yacht Charter\n, these trips let you enjoy all the fun of a charter experience but with a professional crew at the helm.\nOther companies including yacht charter agents like\nSamBoat\n, or\nAnchor.yt\noperate across many Caribbean regions, for sailors of all levels of experience. There are also numerous other companies out there however, including bespoke, luxury charters from specialist companies like\nInter Yacht\n, and\nThe Globe Sailor\n, which may be worth considering.\nFinally, the best way to keep abreast of latest offers is to keep an eye on your preferred company website (see Useful contact list below). Ideally, make contact with the company and relay your holiday requirements because most are happy to help tailor your needs to ensure you experience that dream sailing holiday in the sun.\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Destinations\nIonian Sailing in Autumn: Guide to Exploring Greek Islands in the Off-Season\nPremier Falmouth Marina: Guide and Cruising Grounds\nGuide to Cruising Ithaca: Greek Charter Destinations\nSailing in Corsica, Sardinia & Sicily: Mediterranean Chartering\nChartering in Spain: Guide to Spanish Coast & Balearic Island\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

He took to sailing late in life and used it as a vehicle to sail to parts of the world where there were unclimbed peaks to conquer. He was one tough guy; hardended by experience in the Word War I trenches. He viewed with scorn crew who would not eat sardine spines and, worst of all, men who insisited on wearing gloves at sea in the north Atlantic in the summer. You didn\u2019t sign up with Tilman for a dream cruise.\nOne remark always sticks in my mind. He was often asked \u201chow do I get to go on an expedition\u201d, to which his stark reply was, \u201cyou put on your boots and go\u201d.\nUnhelpful, perhaps, but it is exactly how I learnt how to sail. Wanting to go to sea but having nobody to turn to for advice, I bought myself a 17ft boat up a river in Essex and started to figure it. I went to evening classes to learn how to read a chart and figure the tides but as far as the actual sailing went, I had to figure that out for myself, mostly by trial and error, and plenty of error. But I learnt, slowly. Eventually I took off, alone, across the North Sea. In true Tilman fashion, I just pulled on my (then) yellow wellies and went. Although I say it myself, I haven\u2019t done too badly since. Which is why when newcomers to sailing turn to me for advice, I offer them two options \u2013 find yourself a sailing school, or get those boots on and learn sailing the hard but most rewarding way.\nBut I broke my rule recently and did offer advice to a friend who, fairly late in life, has taken to the water. His boat was also on an east coast river and he wanted to make an ambitious passage north through the Wallet \u2013 a stretch of water I have never found to be in a pleasant mood \u2013 then to Harwich and beyond. I remembered this run well from my early days and so advised him of where to\nanchor\nto wait out a tide, and warned against trying to get into marinas unless he was certain he could drive his feeble-engined craft safely into a berth. Which is why my strongest recommendation was to make full use of his anchor. The\neast coast\nrivers are built for anchoring; you can find shelter from most winds and with a plentiful supply of adhesive mud which grips an anchor like a dog\u2019s mouth on a bone, you can stop, take a pause, put the kettle on and listen to the curlews and move on when the tide serves.\nI heard back from him some weeks later. It didn\u2019t go well. His carefully worked out plan fell apart with headwinds in the Wallet and darkness falling as the tide turned against him. I asked him if my advice on anchorages was any use and he replied, rather meekly, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to use the anchor.\u201d It was very tempting to think less of a chap who has failed to come to grips with one of the fundamental \u2018get your out of trouble\u2019 bits of kit, but the anchor remained a mystery to him.\nBut then I cast my mind back. I remember leaving Brightlingsea, working the tide to the mouth of the Colne, then catching the new flood to take me northwards. Oh, the sheer excitement at seeing the lights of Clacton appearing above the horizon. This was real voyaging.\nAnd then the greatest challenge (which remains to this day) was spotting the diminutive Pye End buoy against the Dovercourt coastline. Much anxiety, then into the Walton Backwaters to drop the anchor in that lovely spot just inside Stone Point. Drifting along, the air was thick with seabirds, grazing horses along the river banks. This was heaven.\nAnd then I dropped anchor \u2013 my first time. The chain rattled but, suspiciously, not for very long. Had I bothered to get it out of its locker before setting off I would have realised that the chain was all of two metres long with a dodgy length of rope attached. I did manage to lengthen it, thanking the Gods for a calm night, since the only other bit of rope on board appeared to have the strength of parcel string.\nSo there we are; two raw beginners nearly 50 years apart making the same stupid mistake. There are some lessons which can only be learnt to hard way, and I reckon my friend probably learnt a few on his adventure. It might be that putting on your boots and getting on with it, is the best teacher of all.\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Cruising Advice\nHow to Sail the French Riviera on a Budget: Navigating Billionaire\u2019s Alley by Boat\nSafe Bluewater Cruising: How to Prepare for a Confident Voyage\nIonian Sailing in Autumn: Guide to Exploring Greek Islands in the Off-Season\nShould Colourblindness Stop You Sailing?\nIs Dinghy Cruising a Better Way to Sail?\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nRaising Children on a Boat: How a Life Under Sail Shapes Our Kids\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Credit: Premier Marinas\nAs far as locations go, the Premier Falmouth Marina is one of the most picturesque you\u2019ll find. It is also well appointed, and conveniently positioned for serious west country cruising and beyond, says Sue Pelling.\n50\u00b0 09\u201990N, 005\u00b005\u201902W\nThe vibrant and historic town of Falmouth in Cornwall, which is located within an area of outstanding natural beauty is one of the most desirable places to visit when cruising the west country. Given its popularity there are plenty of sheltered berthing options available including Premier\u2019s Falmouth Marina, which sits conveniently on the south bank up Penryn River.\nThe main Falmouth harbour, as you enter from the Channel \u2013 Carrick Roads \u2013 is one of the world\u2019s largest natural deep-water harbours and extends northwards as far as the River Fal. In the 18th century it became a bustling hub for packet ships carrying mail, and other commercial goods including\u00a0 timber, iron, coal, and charcoal. It was also an important harbour for the arrival of imported goods such as tea, spices and silks. Falmouth\u2019s defence role in both world wars was crucial too because it served as a base for anti-submarine operations as well as an embarkation point for the D-Day landings.\nFalmouth\u2019s rich maritime heritage continues to be celebrated to this day with events such as the Falmouth Regatta,\nFalmouth Classics\n, the Oyster Festival, and the Falmouth International Sea Shanty Festival taking place every year. Falmouth Marina is within easy walking distance to the main hub which is home to a vast array of independent shops, restaurants and attractions such as Discovery Quay, the National Maritime Museum, and Pendennis Castle.\nWhen you arrive at the marina you can be sure of a warm welcome by Premier\u2019s staff who are on hand 24-hours a day to assist you with your berthing, and any help you require with facilities. As with all Premier Marinas, Falmouth Marina is well designed and laid out for ease of use. It has two berthing areas, with space for boats up to 18m loa on its outer pontoons, and up to 15m loa in its inner basin. For convenience it has a chandlery and restaurant (UpperDeck), and fuel bay for diesel onsite, and has a full-service boatyard as well as a range of businesses including a sailmaker, marine electronic specialist, a rigger, and a yacht broker.\nAnnual berth holders can also benefit from Premier Advantage, which offers a package of rewards, benefits and cost savings including 42 free visitor nights and unlimited short stays at any Premier marina, Sea Start benefits and savings, fuel at cost, special deals on insurance, and up to eight.\nPassage Planning\nThe marina\u2019s location on the south bank of the Penryn River (the first creek you see on the western side of the Fal Estuary) offers easy access but if your boat has a draft of 1.7m, avoid making the approach within 1.5 hours of low water springs. The channel is buoyed and the general approach to the marina is straightforward but it is, however, advisable to consult up-to-date charts, and check notes to mariners at the time of arrival in case of any changes.\nThe access channel is to the southwest of the east cardinal mark. Travel upstream, leaving Greenbank Quay to port. You will see the marina as you pass Boyers Cellars \u2013 a deep-water commercial jetty. Steer close to the marina\u2019s outer pontoons, keeping between them and the east cardinal beacon, which shows the edge of the dredged area.\nWhen you arrive, moor at the visitors\u2019 hammerhead pontoon and call up reception on VHF Ch80 or using the pontoon telephone for berth allocation.\nIt is also worth noting the marina is divided in two by a cill that is marked at each end by a tide gauge. The cill dries to 1.8m above Chart Datum and visitors should only enter the inner basin after being given the go-ahead by marina staff. Finally, if you are a visitor, Premier says it strongly advises pre-booking, especially in peak season because it gives priority access to Premier berth holders visiting from other marinas.\nCruising Grounds\nOnce in the Fal estuary and you base yourself at the marina, you have 12nm of cruising options, stretching as far as the cathedral city of Truro, to explore. With beautiful wooded shorelines and plenty of creeks and places of interest to visit along the way, there\u2019s hardly any need to go anywhere else. Take a sail round to Trelissick for example, where you can anchor off and visit the National Trust Trelissick house and gardens and enjoy the spectacular views. If you are intending to venture further afield to places like the Isles of Scilly, which is approximately 60nm away, or across the Channel, it\u2019s an ideal safe, sheltered base. There are plenty of popular shorter passages on the \u2018doorstep\u2019 too including (to the east) the pretty town of Fowey just 20nm away, Plymouth 38nm away, or Salcombe in Devon 50nm. One of the most delightful places just south around the headland is the Helford River. This is a gem of a place to explore because it\u2019s off the beaten track and offers stunning scenery, plenty of interesting anchorages, and attractive beaches particularly on the north shore of the Helford estuary.\nFurther afield, Jersey and the Channel Islands are logical destinations.\nPremier Falmouth Marina Factfile\nPostcode:\nTR11 2TD\nVHF:\nCh80\nWebsite:\npremiermarinas.com\nEmail:\nfalmouth@premiermarinas.com\nTel:\n+44(0)1326 316 620\nReception open:\n24-hours\nBerthing fees:\nPrices\nPremier Falmouth Marina: Annual Fees\nSmall Boat\n\u2264 6.5m (inside cill) from \u00a32,999 p/a\n>6.5m from \u00a3650 p/m\nSeasonal (min 30 nights)\nOffpeak (Sept-May) from \u00a393.97 p/m\nPeak (June-Aug) from \u00a3104.41 p/m\nVisitor berthing (8m min charge)\nFrom \u00a34.50 p/m p/n\nShort stay (up to 4 hours, 8m min charge)\n\u00a31.60 p/m\nMarina Services\nElectricity: \u00a332.75 p/u\nWater: free of charge\nWifi: Free of charge\nLaundry: Token operated\nFuel: Diesel (call +44(0)1326 316 620)\nBottled Gas: Chandlery\nMarine engineers and workshops: Onsite\nLift out/in: available\nOnsite Businesses\nChandlery: Falmouth Chandlers: +44(0)1326 212411\nBroker: Ancaster +44(0)1326 211007\nRigger/Sailmaking: A2 Rigging, Sails & Covers\u00a0 +44(0)1326 221133\nMarine Engineer/Electrical: Andrew Cox Marine +44(0)7974 250533\nMarine Electronics: BT Marine +44(0)7977 026526\nPlaces to Eat and Drink\nUpperDeck (onsite): +44(0)1326 313481\nIndidog: +44(0)1326 450 699\nThe Shed: +44(0)1326 318502\nThe Greenbank: +44 (0)1326 312440\nThe Boathouse +44 (0)1326 315425\nSupermaket: Sainsburys TR11 2RZ (5 min walk)\nNearest railway station: Penmere\u00a0 (20 min walk)\nTaxis: Taxi A2B Falmouth: +44 (0)1326 317898\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Destinations\nIonian Sailing in Autumn: Guide to Exploring Greek Islands in the Off-Season\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nGuide to Cruising Ithaca: Greek Charter Destinations\nSailing in Corsica, Sardinia & Sicily: Mediterranean Chartering\nChartering in Spain: Guide to Spanish Coast & Balearic Island\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

You\u2019ll find that many Caribbean islands that run regattas are major social and cultural events, blending sport, music, food, and island spirit. This cocktail of hard core, adrenaline-driven racing, and legendary rum punch-fuelled apr\u00e8s-race parties are what Caribbean regattas are all about because above all they foster unforgettable memories and friendships that will probably last a lifetime.\nThe main Caribbean race season runs from January to late April, which not only avoids the hurricane season, but also gives overseas visitors plenty of time to make their trip south worthwhile, with many, particularly pro teams, using the Caribbean circuit as an ideal shake down to the forthcoming northern hemisphere race season.\nCaribbean race charter  |  Photo credit: Gabe Rovick\nThere is a packed calendar of regattas to choose from and, thanks to the Caribbean Sailing Association (\nCSA\n), which promotes each event with its own identity, dates rarely clash, which means you could realistically take part in the whole Caribbean race series.\nIf however, holiday time is limited, you may want to return to your favourite haunt with events like\nSt Maarten Heineken Regatta\n, the\nBVI Spring Regatta & Sailing Festival\n, or\nAntigua Sailing Week\nsome of the most popular. For something different, yet equally fun and extremely competitive, maybe consider St Thomas International Regatta or St Barths Bucket.\nGiven its popularity, there\u2019s a good choice of race yacht charter companies serving the Caribbean and covering events and feeder race/cruises such as the\nWorld Cruising Club Atlantic Rally for Cruisers\n(ARC and ARC+) an event which sets off across the Atlantic from Gran Canaria to the Caribbean mid to late November. This means there are many opportunities to sign up for a berth on either a private charter yacht, or charter yacht through companies such as LV Yachting, Go West Sailing, or Firstaway Yacht Charter.\nWhile many companies offer crewed or bareboat charter options, a growing sector is individual berth charter. Sea to Sky Sailing primarily offers individual berth race charter opportunities aboard its race optimised Salona 45,\nPanacea X\n. Katy Campbell (Sea to Sky Sailing Director and lead race skipper) commented: \u201cWe are a frequent feature of the podium across the whole Caribbean circuit, and in 2025 were awarded the Traveler\u2019s Trophy for being the top performing boat of the year. We are usually the only female-skippered boat on the circuit, often the only one flying the maple leaf, and one of the few associated with an RYA training centre.\nAntigua English Harbour, Nelson's Dockyard  |  Photo credit: Shutterstock\n\u201cFor the 2025/2026 Caribbean season, we will be racing in St Lucia\u2019s Mango Bowl, Barbados Sailing Week, Rum to Spice Offshore Race, Grenada Sailing Week, RORC Caribbean 600, St Maarten Heineken Regatta, BVI Regatta and Antigua Sailing Week. We\u2019re looking forward to another great season and look forward to having many familiar faces back on board as well as new crew joining us from all over the world.\u201d\nAnother popular company is LV Yachting which specialises in race yacht charters across the Caribbean, and is passionate about connecting teams with high-performance yachts \u2013 from Volvo Ocean 65s and ORC winners to multihulls and top-tier racer cruisers. LV\u2019s Chris Bruty commenting on what\u2019s on offer said: \u201cWe offer whole-boat and crewed charters for events including the RORC Caribbean 600, Heineken Regatta, BVI Spring Regatta, Antigua Sailing Week and more. With 15+ years\u2019 experience, we tailor every charter to the crew\u2019s needs, handling logistics like berthing, race entry, and concierge support. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned campaigner or new to Caribbean regattas, our personalised service ensures a competitive, seamless and unforgettable racing experience.\u201d\nAs well as being one of the key cruising charter companies, Sunsail also offers a range of race charter options in the Caribbean. Caroline Barbour, Sunsail\u2019s Marketing Manager UK/ZA/AU said: \u201cOur team of expert holiday planners can offer advice on chartering a bareboat or skippered yacht, suitable for seasoned crews and those new to racing. The key events for next season include the BVI Spring Regatta, Antigua Sailing Week, Grenada Sailing Week, and the St Maarten Heineken Regatta.\n\u201cCustomers benefit from the maintained charter fleet and access to Sunsail\u2019s experienced skippers. It\u2019s an excellent way to gain race entry, shore-side support, and seamless participation in top-tier Caribbean regattas. Off the water, racers enjoy legendary socials, island hospitality, and an unbeatable party atmosphere that comes with every regatta.\u201d\nSecond Star Sailing, which participates in events such as Grenada Sailing Week, RORC 600 Caribbean, St Maarten Heineken Regatta, and St Barths Bucket also specialises in women\u2019s sailing, and is particularly keen to promote its Women at the Helm in the Caribbean. Second Star Sailing\u2019s Aliya Brown commenting on this popular programme said: \u201cThrough our all-women race team programme, Women at the Helm, Second Star Sailing is happy to support women in competitive sailing. Our two-week package is meant to give female sailors more confidence and skills.\n\u201cIt includes a full week of race training skills to support passionate women in developing their skills in any role on a racing team, whether they are helm, trimmer, bow, or tactician. During the second week, we will be on the water for Antigua Sailing Week, racing with a crew that is excited to share their knowledge. Based in Antigua, we are dedicated to getting more women involved in racing by giving them access, mentoring, and world-class training in a lively regatta setting.\u201d\nFinally it\u2019s worth remembering that access to the Caribbean with direct flights from the UK to many islands makes chartering a yacht a good option particularly if leisure time is more restricted. If you are flexible with time, you may be able to find some good last-minute deals, so it\u2019s worth keeping an eye out online (see Useful contacts below).\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Charter Tips\nAdventure Sailing Holiday Guide: Where to Find Thrilling Charter Experiences\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nThe State of the Industry: Insights from VentureSail\nYacht Ownership Scheme Guide: Fractional & Shared Ownership\nWhat Is the Secret to Sunsail\u2019s Success?\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Sam Jefferson caught up with Sunsail\u2019s Clive Norton to find out the company\u2019s secrets of success\n.\nLast year, Sunsail celebrated an incredible milestone \u2013 its 50th anniversary. A half-century of helping adventure-lovers explore the world from the deck of an award-winning yacht is no mean feat. Such an achievement can only be accredited to the consistent vision that has guided the company over the decades, with each generation of leadership united by a clear goal \u2013 to deliver unforgettable sailing experiences for the sailing community and beyond. To mark the occasion, we caught up with Clive Norton, VP of Revenue Management and Fleet Planning at Sunsail, to reflect on the company\u2019s roots, discussing the journey from launching a small fleet in the Saronic Gulf to becoming a world leading sailing holiday company. In this exclusive interview, we delve into Sunsail\u2019s origins, its milestones and where it is heading next.\nSunsail Vounaki Greece May 2010\nTell us about the history of Sunsail. How did it all begin?\n\u201cSunsail was founded in 1974 and began with the simple ambition to make sailing fun, accessible, and social for everyone. Our very first base was in Aegina, in the stunning Saronic Gulf of Greece, which we still sail from today. We started with just seven 25ft Snapdragon monohulls in the first flotilla. They were sturdy yachts known for their twin bilge keels, shallow draft and spacious interiors \u2013 perfect for exploring coastal waters, with ample space in the galley to cater for a family while offering relative comfort. It was a modest start, but one rooted in a deep passion for the sea.\n\u201cThe team back then was small but mighty. Skipper Janet Green led the first voyages with her Australian hostie, Megan, and English engineer David Archer. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know much about their history before Sunsail, but we do know that Janet\u2019s role was particularly groundbreaking for the time. In 1974, it was quite rare \u2013 and often challenging \u2013 for a woman to hold a lead skipper position in the sailing world, which was then overwhelmingly male-dominated. Janet\u2019s leadership not only showcased her exceptional skills and determination but also set an early example of inclusivity and progressiveness that Sunsail continues to embody today.\n\u201cThis spirit of representation and breaking boundaries set by Janet and the team has continued to shape decision-making within the business. It\u2019s no coincidence that Dee Caffari is one of Sunsail\u2019s contemporary ambassadors. Dee made history as the first woman to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in both directions, and she remains one of the most respected figures in the sport. Her achievements resonate deeply with the values set by the founding team.\n\u201cNeedless to say, the first ever flotilla trip was a great success, reaching beyond the expectations of the team, and went on to create the first market for holiday flotillas.\u201d\nHow has Sunsail evolved over the years?\n\u201cOver the last five decades, we\u2019ve come a long way. From those first flotilla holidays in Greece, we expanded across the Mediterranean, then into the Caribbean, and now offer bareboat charters in over 20 of the world\u2019s most spectacular sailing destinations. Our flotilla sailing holidays now run in three countries, and our fleet has grown from seven Snapdragons to over 340 yachts.\n\u201cThroughout our journey, we\u2019ve worked closely with iconic yacht manufacturers like Beneteau, Jeanneau, and Robertson & Caine to ensure our boats balance performance, comfort and sociability for our guests. Since the first flotilla in 1974 we have steadily invested in the fleet. By the late 1980s we had already added 120 new yachts to the Mediterranean. In 1993, we were operating 390 yachts across the Mediterranean and 100 in the Caribbean. In 2002, we placed a landmark \u00a313 million order for 180 new yachts from Jeanneau, Beneteau, Fountaine Pajot, and Lagoon, further strengthening our global offering.\n\u201cFleet renewal and expansion continued into the 2010s, with major additions from Robertson & Caine\u2019s catamaran range and upgrades to our monohull fleet to match evolving guest expectations. In 2016, we introduced the Sunsail 454 \u2013 a custom-built catamaran designed specifically for the charter market. In 2020, we launched the Sunsail 41.0, a sleek, modern yacht created in collaboration with Jeanneau. Most recently, in 2023 and 2024, we continued our fleet growth through a partnership with Dufour, investing in models such as the Sunsail 37.3 and Sunsail 41.3., reflecting our growing focus on sustainability and innovation. Each phase of fleet growth has furthered our commitment to staying ahead of industry trends and delivering exceptional sailing experiences for every type of sailor.\n\u201cAs we have grown the fleet, we have also deepened our offering to our community, which has seen our team pioneering experiences that accompany sailors through their entire journey. In 1986, we launched our first Beach Club to offer beginner-friendly holiday packages combining land and water-based activities. This marked the beginning of a series of Beach Clubs that followed across the Mediterranean and beyond. This period of time marked the opening of a new space in the market, where sailing enthusiasts could not only enjoy a holiday, but also earn their first sailing qualifications.\n\u201cBy the mid-2010s our strategy evolved and moved towards a direction more closely reflecting the business we operate today \u2013 focusing on accessibility through our\nRYA\n-accredited Sailing Schools. From there, guests could progress to flotillas and eventually set off on their own bareboat adventures.\u201d\nWhat do you think has been the secret behind Sunsail\u2019s success?\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s that Sunsail has always been run by sailors, for sailors. We understand what makes a sailing holiday special because we live and breathe it ourselves. Our goal has never changed \u2013 we want to make sailing fun, inclusive, and accessible to all.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re passionate \u2013 deeply passionate \u2013 about what we do, and how we do it. That enthusiasm translates into everything from how we design our itineraries to how our teams interact with guests. It\u2019s about creating unforgettable experiences and lifelong memories on the water.\u201d\nSunsail Vounaki Greece May 2010\nWhat are some of the most memorable highlights over the last 50 years?\n\u201cThere are so many. Launching our Caribbean bases was a big step, bringing the Sunsail experience to turquoise waters and island cultures. Another huge moment was expanding our fleet beyond the Mediterranean and adding yachts from world-renowned manufacturers.\n\u201cBut I think the most rewarding moments are the ones we hear from our guests \u2013 families who return year after year, couples who met on a flotilla and now bring their children back, or sailors who took their first lessons with us and are now skippering charters around the world. Those personal stories are what really define our legacy.\u201d\nWhat makes Sunsail unique today?\n\u201cToday, our guests have more choice than ever before. Looking for a self-guided adventure? Our bareboat charters offer the freedom to explore at your own pace \u2013 and in some locations, we\u2019re even introducing off-grid itineraries for a more remote experience. Prefer a little more structure and camaraderie? Our flotillas provide a sociable and supportive way to sail, with the added reassurance of a lead crew always close by. And if you\u2019re new to sailing, no problem \u2013 our RYA-accredited sailing schools are designed to help you learn while on holiday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hand-picked our destinations for their beauty and variety in sailing conditions \u2013 from the gentle breezes of the Ionian to the steady trade winds of the British Virgin Islands. It\u2019s all about catering to every level of sailor, from complete beginners to seasoned skippers.\nAt the heart of our business, we\u2019ve stayed true to our core values \u2013 particularly when it comes to customer service. From the very first call, guests are supported by expert holiday planners, who have sailed in the waters they\u2019re recommending. This is a deliberate choice \u2013 we want our guests to feel confident knowing they\u2019re speaking to someone with real, first-hand knowledge. That personalised service continues throughout the holiday experience, thanks to our base managers and local lead crews, who have the local insight and ability to make every guest feel supported and welcome.\u201d\nWhat do the next 50 years hold for Sunsail?\n\u201cThe next 50 years are all about sustainability and innovation. We\u2019re standing on the brink of real change in the yachting world \u2013 in how hulls are built, how boats are powered, and how we protect marine ecosystems. We want to lead that charge.\n\u201cThrough our charitable partners and award-winning internal sustainability initiatives, we\u2019re already laying the groundwork. We\u2019re also exploring how to work more responsibly with local communities in every destination we operate.\n\u201cFrom a design perspective, we\u2019ll continue to collaborate with top manufacturers to stay at the forefront of yacht innovation. Listening to our guests is key \u2013 they help us find that sweet spot where comfort, performance and sociability meet.\u201d\nSunsail\u2019s journey from a humble flotilla in the Saronic Gulf to a global sailing holiday pioneer is more than a business success story \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration to a vision dedicated to a genuine love for life on the water.\nSpeaking with Clive, it\u2019s clear that while the fleet, destinations, and technology have evolved, Sunsail\u2019s core purpose has not wavered. As the brand looks ahead to the next 50 years, one thing is certain \u2013 the spirit that launched seven Snapdragons in 1974 still guides every voyage today.\nShow Me More:\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Charter Tips\nAdventure Sailing Holiday Guide: Where to Find Thrilling Charter Experiences\nCaribbean Charter Holiday Guide: Finding the Best Winter Sailing Destination\nThe State of the Industry: Insights from VentureSail\nHow to Go Racing in the Caribbean: Chartering for All Skill Levels\nYacht Ownership Scheme Guide: Fractional & Shared Ownership\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

In the Gold fleet Bergamasco also proved that consistency was the name of the game because he won the title without winning a single race!\nWASZP Games  |  Photo credit: Down Under Sail\nCommenting on his overall win after the final race, a delighted Bergamasco said: \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing week with super racing. There was a lot of pressure on today [final day] because we all wanted to win. Staying in the top five was everything, so I had to fight with these amazing guys \u2013 Pablo [Astiazaran P\u00e9rez-Cela], Antonio [Gasperini], and Gavin [Ball] \u2013 to stay on top.\u201d\nLattanzi chatting about her overall win, added: \u201cI\u2019m so happy. I don\u2019t even know what to say. It doesn\u2019t feel real now. The qualifying was pretty windy for me, so I was so happy to qualify for the Gold fleet. It was the most boats I\u2019d ever raced against in a fleet and it was really competitive racing.\u201d\nWith three main classes \u2013 determined by rig size \u2013 8.2, 7.5 and 6.9, plus a smaller 5.8 (WASZP X) \u2013 the event attracted a huge, diverse fleet ranging from foiling demons including youngsters, women, to 50+ Super Masters. Each fleet raced early rounds to qualify for the finals within the Gold, Silver and Bronze fleets, so effectively there were three overall champions within the fleets.\nWASZP Games Weymouth  |  Photo credit: Down Under Sail\nAndrew McDougall \u2013 the WASZP designer, and a Super Master 50+, flying the flag for Australia \u2013 fought off some equally tough competition to take the Bronze championship title with three wins to count, from British sailor Pia Raber (Junior Under 19). Another top British finisher was Ben Harris (Core 21-29 year old) who sailed impressively to take second place overall in the Silver fleet.\nIt was good to see so many women taking the plunge to compete equally with the men. A total of 18% of the fleet were women and it was another Italian \u2013 Olivia Castaldi \u2013 who won the 6.9 division overall, while Lattanzi secured her overall win by finishing a creditable 34th in the final 70-strong Gold fleet. The top British-placed woman was Chloe Collenette who was 44th in the Silver fleet.\nIn keeping with the WASZP class\u2019 ethos of inclusivity, there was also a category for total foiling beginners \u2013 the Green Fleet \u2013 with 10 in the fleet ranging from a 12 year old to 60+ club sailors enjoying a fun week of coaching and racing. Some of the youth sailors progressed so fast in the first couple of days, they made the decision to join the main 6.9 fleet for the rest of the week.\nMartin Evans \u2013 WASZP Class Manager said the \u2018Green Fleet was a huge success: \u201cIt helped newcomers to the fleet experience the Games with the chance to step up to the main fleet. The daily debriefs, tech talks, yoga, music and socials added real value and made the whole Games a fun and rewarding place to be.\u201d\nAs an older sailor new to the WASZP, Derek Stannett (Super Master division 50+) said he found the Green Fleet experience invaluable. \u201cIt got me onto the water in an environment that was directly linked to the main event where I could learn from experienced coaches as well as observe other sailors, both in the Green fleet and beyond\u2026My confidence improved dramatically during the week, heightening my enthusiasm for future events. It was also fantastic to make a group of new friends who I will hopefully see at future events and progress with.\u201d\nAt the other end of the age spectrum, Alice Pope (18) another new-comer said the Green Fleet was a real confidence-builder: \u201cI basically learnt how to sail a WASZP! By the end of the week we were all doing races and attempting foiling gybes. This gave me confidence that after some more practice I would be able to compete in some of the winter events in the 7.5 fleet in the UK.\u201d\nAs well as the well-organised racing, it is the camaraderie and social side of any championship that helps to determine its success, so it wasn\u2019t surprising to see the WASZP Games scoring top marks on all accounts. Duncan Hepplewhite \u2013 acting UK class chairman and director of\nSailingfast\n(UK & Ireland Distributors for the WASZP) said the week was full on: \u201cSocial events are a big part of the Games and for this event, we even ran a special Masters\u2019 evening at the local Bee Hive community-run cafe, for example. We also had some elite sailors from the Youth America\u2019s Cup, all WASZP sailors who\u2019d progressed to the America\u2019s Cup, who came along and ran a presentation with a question and answer session. The big event of the week of course, was overall prizegiving, which was a Champagne spread in the sun with a Formula 1-style presentation.\u201d\nWASZP Games prize giving  |  Photo credit: Down Under Sail\nRounding up a successful event, Evans added: \u201cThe WASZP Games was an unbelievable experience for the sailors but equally for me as an organiser. It was a \u2018pinch yourself moment\u2019 on day one, when all the sails with flags and colours went up in the boat park and WPNSA was suddenly overrun with 248 WASZPs! We had spectacular racing every day despite imperfect wind conditions in the second half of the week, and the famous WASZP culture always shone throughout.\u201d\nLooking forward to next year\u2019s events and beyond, Evans concluded: \u201cIn 2026 we\u2019ll be heading to Pensacola [Florida] for the Games, which will be the first time for the event in the Americas. We also have the 2026 Europeans in Mar Menor, Murcia, Spain in July which I expect to top 200 boats, and we have some big news on the horizon for 2027.\u201d\nShow Me More:\nNew Boats: Fresh Designs on the Yacht Market\nMicky Beckett\u2019s Comeback: Positives of the Professional Circuit\nHow to Face Bad Weather at Sea: Adrian Morgan\u2019s Stormy tales\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\nAdvertisement\nMore from Races & Regattas\nDylan Fletcher\u2019s Inside Scoop on SailGP: Emirates GBR Making History\nAllspars Final Fling 2025: Royal Western Yacht Club\u2019s End of Season Sailing Shakedown\nWill the America\u2019s Cup Survive?\nOffshore Rising Stars Ellie Driver & Ollie Hill: Young Short-Hand Ambition and Success\nThe Dramatic Transat Caf\u00e9 L\u2019Or: Capsizes and Winners 2025\nBritish Team Win SailGP 2025: Emirates GBR Take Gold in Abu Dhabi\nMore from Sailing Today\nA Challenging Transatlantic: ARC+ British Crews Share Their Tales on Arrival\nLearning to Sail the Hard Way: Paul Heiney\u2019s Advice for Beginners\nLeopard 46 Boat Test: How to Cruise in Comfort\nFlotilla Sailing with Sunsail: Expert-Led Adventures at Sea\nCruising Greece to Malta: Bob Shepton Heads to the Med with Environmental Initiative\n2026 RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show: What to Look Forward To\nBack to top ^\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025\nFOLLOW US\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nTelegraph.co.uk\nContact Us\n\u00a9 The Chelsea Magazine Company 2025\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2025",

Major technical and interior milestones have now been completed and the superyacht is on track for her scheduled 2026 delivery.\nAccording to the shipyard, works are now progressing on all plumbing, piping and technical installations alongside the production of teak decking and paint preparation. The new build will then undergo engine installation, paint completion and interior joinery ahead of her launch, sea trials and handover this year.\nThe model \u2013 penned by Sirena\u2019s in-house design team \u2013 was first unveiled at the 2024\nMonaco Yacht Show\nas the largest in the shipyard\u2019s composite line, built entirely in GRP with a sub-300GT volume and a flexible tri-deck layout.\n7 images\nDutch designer\nCor D. Rover\nis the brain behind the model's customisable interior design, which is said by the yard to be \"contemporary-styled\" and \"highly elegant\". Rover has used an \"understated yet elegant\" colour scheme, wood veneer applications and integrated soft lighting to create a sophisticated yet inviting ambience.\nCream upholstery, light wood tones and bronze accents characterise the decor - also chosen to help accentuate the spaces\u2019 natural light, which, according to the yard, evolves from day to night with the glow from the rising to the setting sun.\nAccommodation is for up to 12 guests and seven crew on board, with the guest accommodation comprising a VIP suite and four guest cabins on the lower deck. The shipyard has dedicated significant attention to the owner's area, which is located forward on the main deck and can extend across two decks in a \"loft\" option. A spiral staircase connects to a private relaxation space on the lower deck, which features a fold-down balcony.\nThere are plenty of social areas across the model's design, including an informal dining and lounging area on the main deck aft, outfitted with curvaceous contemporary furniture and curated fittings, while further dining and a wet bar can be found on the upper deck. Meanwhile, a Jacuzzi sits in the yacht's bow, flanked by sunpads and loungers.\nWith naval architecture by respected Argentinian naval architect\nGerm\u00e1n Frers\n, a fast displacement hull will give her a top speed of 16 knots, propelled by twin MAN V12 3,100hp engines. With a more powerful 3,800hp package, she will deliver a top speed of 21 knots.\n\u201cAs the first Sirena 118 continues to take shape, we are proud to see the design vision materialising across every area of the build,\u201d shared Sirena Yachts CEO, \u00c7a\u011fin Genc. \u201cThe craftsmanship of our team, together with our long-standing partners such as Cor D. Rover and Germ\u00e1n Frers, is bringing this new flagship to life in a way that truly reflects the spirit of Sirena.\u201d\nThe Turkish yard is also working towards the completion of its flagship yacht \u2013\u00a0created in collaboration with\nLuca Vallebona\nand\nHot Lab\n\u2013 which is currently under construction in Yalova, Turkey, with delivery also scheduled for 2026.\nRead More\n/\nSirena Yachts' 42m flagship hits milestone ahead of 2026 launch\nSign up to BOAT Briefing email\nLatest news, brokerage headlines and yacht exclusives, every weekday\nSubmit\nSimilar yachts for sale\nHeliophilia\nSirena Yachts\n26.82\nm \u2022\n12\nguests\n\u20ac7,750,000\nSIRENA 118\nSirena Yachts\n36\nm \u2022\n12\nguests\n\u20ac15,500,000\nMore stories\n\u20ac2M price drop on 30m hybrid Royal Huisman sailing yacht Foftein\nDOM155: Baglietto unveils 46m flagship DOM line yacht model\nConstruction begins on first Lazzara UHV 160 with H2 Yacht Design interiors\nFirst 24m Bering 78 explorer yacht Slow Ride launched\n31m rebuilt sailing yacht Palm Beach XI marks delivery with Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race\nLogos: ER Yacht Design unveils latest yacht concept with motion appearance\nMost popular\nKoru: The best photos of Jeff Bezos\u2019 record-breaking sailing yacht\nInside Hodor: The mind-blowing superyacht support vessel with toys for every terrain\nEverything we know about the Bayesian yacht tragedy one year on\nChristina O: What happened to Aristotle Onassis' 99m superyacht?\nOn board L\u00fcrssen's 122m Kismet, the Motor Yacht of the Year 2025\nRoman shipwrecks, bioluminescent turtles and other amazing discoveries made by superyachts\nNero: On board the 90m superyacht that's an exact replica of a classic\nAn open mind: On board Alia Yachts' dayboat-inspired superyacht SAN\nThe story of the crew member who struck gold and became a superyacht owner\n\"The big dog on the SpaceCat!\": Inside the futuristic catamaran featured in The White Lotus\nPredator: the speed-optimised superyacht that got a design carte blanche from her captain\nThis Is It: On board the radical 43m catamaran that emerged from a daring brief\nFrom our partners\nIs this the most radical 200GT motor yacht ever built?\nExploring Asia: The new luxury ocean travel experience setting sail in 2027-2028\nQuick Group unveils major upgrades to its gyro stabilisers and next-generation SeaCentric system\nTalk to your yacht: Sirena introduces voice-controlled AI across its fleet with Vanemar and Garmin\nThe luxury entertainment brand every superyacht owner should know\nInside Frida: The latest 55m on-spec Heesen awaiting an owner\u2019s personal touch\nSponsored listings\nMISS MICHELLE\nHorizon\n\u2022\n37.2\nm \u2022\n8\nguests \u2022\n$16,450,000\nSEVEN SINS\nSanlorenzo\n\u2022\n52\nm \u2022\n11\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac28,000,000\nNIKKI BELLA\nViking\n\u2022\n27.43\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n$15,475,000\nEmina\nBenetti\n\u2022\n42.67\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$16,950,000\nSEAWOLF X\nRossinavi\n\u2022\n42.84\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac36,900,000\nBOUJIE\nViking\n\u2022\n24.99\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$12,145,000\nFIVE WAVES\nAB Yachts - Next Yacht Group\n\u2022\n35.99\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$4,250,000\nCHECKMATE\nBenetti\n\u2022\n44.2\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac10,900,000\nSubscribe to Newsletters\nSubscribe to Newsletters\nAdvertising & Media Kit\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nMore from BOAT International\nYachts\nYachts For Sale\nCharter\nDestinations\nBoat Life\nBoat Presents\nEvents\nBOATPro\nShop\nSite Map\nbcreative.studio\nFollow us on\nSubscribe\nSign up to our newsletters\nSign up to BOAT International email newsletters to get the latest superyacht news, business analysis, exclusive event invitations, and more.\nSign up\nBACK TO TOP\nBoat International Media Ltd \u00a9 2008 - 2025.\nContent presented under the \"BOAT Presents\" logo is an advertising feature and Boat International Limited has been paid to include this content.",

The first 46.4-metre unit will be available in early 2029.\nThe new model comes as an evolution of the popular 40.9-metre DOM133 line, which has 12 units sold, and the 34.5-metre DOM115 line, which has four new build orders to date. Characterised by a sub-500GT volume, the new displacement motor yacht follows the previous models' Roman domus concept of \"warm, welcoming and refined\", now expanded with larger volumes and \"enhanced liveability\".\nItalian designer and long-time Baglietto collaborator\nStefano Vafiadis\nhas returned for the design of the DOM155. Vafiadis describes the design as \u201cclean and sculptural,\" while \u201cnever excessive, yet balanced and aggressive at the same time, featuring longitudinal cuts and taut volumes inspired by automotive design.\u201d\nTaking inspiration from the DOM133, the DOM155 features generous volumes, floor-to-ceiling glazing and a \"seamless dialogue\" between interior and exterior spaces.\nThe main focus of the model is found in the stern. Dedicated to relaxation and well-being, the space features a central panoramic infinity pool with steps on either side leading to the aft cockpit. This space can be configured with a spa and gym overlooking the sea, thanks to a fold-down port-side shell door, or as an additional tender garage if desired.\nThe aft swimming platform also features a large transformer for swimming and easy dock access\nInside, living areas comprise a main deck saloon with a dining table for ten guests aft, and an upper deck saloon which opens on three sides for panoramic views. Also on the main deck is the owner's suite, which spans the yacht's full beam and is fitted with a walk-in closet, a master bedroom with a California king-size bed and a spacious his-and-hers en suite with a \"walk-through\" shower.\nFour en suite guest cabins are located on the lower deck, forward of which is accommodation for a crew of eight in addition to a crew mess and laundry area. An additional guest cabin can also be incorporated on the upper deck if desired.\nOther lounge spaces on board can be found forward of the wheelhouse (near a technical area housing a tender and jet ski) and a 130-square-metre sundeck fitted with sunbathing areas, a \"conversation lounge\" and an infinity pool with an integrated bar.\n4 images\nThe latest DOM 133 yacht\nSui Generis\nwas launched in July 2025\nIn keeping with the DOM133, aluminium has been chosen as the construction material for the DOM155, allowing for greater customisation alongside improved performance and a shallow draught. As such, the project is particularly appealing to the American market, of which the La Spezia\u2013based shipyard notes as one of its most important markets.\n\u201cThe DOM155 is the result of listening carefully to our clients and, more broadly, to the market, which has enthusiastically welcomed both the 35- and 41-metre models but has repeatedly expressed interest in larger dimensions,\u201d explained Baglietto\u2019s chief commercial officer, Fabio Ermetto.\nHe continued: \u201cThis project, developed together with architect Stefano Vafiadis, brings together many of the improvement suggestions and experiences shared by our owners over the years, resulting in a yacht with high levels of customisation, comfort, and liveability that we are confident will fit perfectly into the sub-500 GT yacht segment.\u201d\nThe DOM155 will be powered by twin CAT C32 engines, capable of reaching a 16-knot maximum speed.\nAccording to\nBOATPro\n, Baglietto currently has 18 yachts on order or under construction, including three 60-metre T60 yacht models.\nRead More\n/\nThe bigger, bolder sister: A closer look at Baglietto\u2019s T60 superyacht in build\nSign up to BOAT Briefing email\nLatest news, brokerage headlines and yacht exclusives, every weekday\nSubmit\nSimilar yachts for sale\nNEW MASTER\nBaglietto\n44.46\nm \u2022\n12\nguests\n\u20ac7,000,000\nGRAND CRU\nBaglietto\n48.9\nm \u2022\n14\nguests\n$6,800,000\nMore stories\nConstruction begins on first Lazzara UHV 160 with H2 Yacht Design interiors\nFirst 24m Bering 78 explorer yacht Slow Ride launched\n31m rebuilt sailing yacht Palm Beach XI marks delivery with Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race\nLogos: ER Yacht Design unveils latest yacht concept with motion appearance\nThree yachts sink following marina fire in Sydney, Australia\nVan der Valk begins construction on custom 30m Project Berlin\nMost popular\nKoru: The best photos of Jeff Bezos\u2019 record-breaking sailing yacht\nInside Hodor: The mind-blowing superyacht support vessel with toys for every terrain\nEverything we know about the Bayesian yacht tragedy one year on\nChristina O: What happened to Aristotle Onassis' 99m superyacht?\nOn board L\u00fcrssen's 122m Kismet, the Motor Yacht of the Year 2025\nRoman shipwrecks, bioluminescent turtles and other amazing discoveries made by superyachts\nNero: On board the 90m superyacht that's an exact replica of a classic\nAn open mind: On board Alia Yachts' dayboat-inspired superyacht SAN\nThe story of the crew member who struck gold and became a superyacht owner\n\"The big dog on the SpaceCat!\": Inside the futuristic catamaran featured in The White Lotus\nPredator: the speed-optimised superyacht that got a design carte blanche from her captain\nThis Is It: On board the radical 43m catamaran that emerged from a daring brief\nFrom our partners\nIs this the most radical 200GT motor yacht ever built?\nTalk to your yacht: Sirena introduces voice-controlled AI across its fleet with Vanemar and Garmin\nExploring Asia: The new luxury ocean travel experience setting sail in 2027-2028\nUninterrupted internet at sea: A complete guide to hybrid superyacht connectivity\nWhy Panama is the superyacht destination you\u2019ve been overlooking\nThe luxury entertainment brand every superyacht owner should know\nSponsored listings\nMISS MICHELLE\nHorizon\n\u2022\n37.2\nm \u2022\n8\nguests \u2022\n$16,450,000\nSEVEN SINS\nSanlorenzo\n\u2022\n52\nm \u2022\n11\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac28,000,000\nNIKKI BELLA\nViking\n\u2022\n27.43\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n$15,475,000\nEmina\nBenetti\n\u2022\n42.67\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$16,950,000\nSEAWOLF X\nRossinavi\n\u2022\n42.84\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac36,900,000\nBOUJIE\nViking\n\u2022\n24.99\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$12,145,000\nFIVE WAVES\nAB Yachts - Next Yacht Group\n\u2022\n35.99\nm \u2022\n10\nguests \u2022\n$4,250,000\nCHECKMATE\nBenetti\n\u2022\n44.2\nm \u2022\n12\nguests \u2022\n\u20ac10,900,000\nSubscribe to Newsletters\nSubscribe to Newsletters\nAdvertising & Media Kit\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nMore from BOAT International\nYachts\nYachts For Sale\nCharter\nDestinations\nBoat Life\nBoat Presents\nEvents\nBOATPro\nShop\nSite Map\nbcreative.studio\nFollow us on\nSubscribe\nSign up to our newsletters\nSign up to BOAT International email newsletters to get the latest superyacht news, business analysis, exclusive event invitations, and more.\nSign up\nBACK TO TOP\nBoat International Media Ltd \u00a9 2008 - 2025.\nContent presented under the \"BOAT Presents\" logo is an advertising feature and Boat International Limited has been paid to include this content.",

It has been designed to shorten processing timelines and transform the information-seeking journey into a smooth, reliable and fully integrated digital experience. The guide also includes a comprehensive FAQ section, along with clear, advisory-based guidance outlining permitted and prohibited practices.\nThe first series of the guide is dedicated to yachting activities, offering a clear and practical end-to-end pathway for a yacht\u2019s journey from arrival to departure. This includes procedures, documentation, licenses and permits, mechanisms for identifying and confirming the port of entry (port/marina) through a licensed agent, as well as directories of approved service providers (maritime tourism agents, yacht charter companies and marinas). It also includes safety and environmental sustainability guidelines, alongside periodic updates of regulatory requirements.\nAMAALA Triple Bay\n\"The significance of the guide stems from its role as a foundational enabler for the coastal tourism activities sector, one of the key drivers of tourism growth,\" the SRSA stated. \"Its launch is the result of intensive coordination efforts led by the Authority in collaboration with relevant entities to ensure role integration, foster an attractive tourism and investment environment, support the\u00a0sector\u2019s accelerating growth and align with the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030.\"\nThe announcement forms part of a broader effort to enhance yachting activity within Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea.\nBOATPro\nrecently spoke with the CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority (STA) to learn more about the country\u2019s bold plans for transforming the yachting landscape and the future of tourism in the region.\nRead More\n/\nInterview: Saudi Tourism Authority on positioning the Red Sea as superyachting's next frontier\nSign up to BOATPro News\nYes, please send me BOATPro News email newsletter, delivered every Wednesday.\nSubmit\nRead more\nMarinas\nSafe Harbor acquires Front Street Shipyard\nboat_pro_news\nMarinas\nBlackstone to acquire Hamilton Island resort in Australia\nboat_pro_news\nIn review\nThe most travelled yachts of 2025\nboat_pro_news\nFinancial results\nOyster Yachts reports improved FY25 results amid turnaround\nboat_pro_news\nUAE\nForeign yachts now able to move freely between Abu Dhabi and Dubai\nboat_pro_news\nBrokerage report\nDecember sales up 66% year on year\nboat_pro_news\nFrom our partners\nPershing turns 40: Celebrating a rich history and revealing what lies ahead\nIs this the most radical 200GT motor yacht ever built?\nThe luxury entertainment brand every superyacht owner should know\nUninterrupted internet at sea: A complete guide to hybrid superyacht connectivity\nWhy Panama is the superyacht destination you\u2019ve been overlooking\nTalk to your yacht: Sirena introduces voice-controlled AI across its fleet with Vanemar and Garmin\nAdvertising & Media Kit\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nMore from BOAT International\nYachts\nYachts For Sale\nCharter\nDestinations\nBoat Life\nBoat Presents\nEvents\nBOATPro\nShop\nSite Map\nbcreative.studio\nFollow us on\nSubscribe\nSign up to our newsletters\nSign up to BOAT International email newsletters to get the latest superyacht news, business analysis, exclusive event invitations, and more.\nSign up\nBACK TO TOP\nBoat International Media Ltd \u00a9 2008 - 2025.\nContent presented under the \"BOAT Presents\" logo is an advertising feature and Boat International Limited has been paid to include this content.",
