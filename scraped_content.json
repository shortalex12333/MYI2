It includes liability coverage for bodily injury or damage to the property of others and damage to personal property on the vessel. Depending on the insurance provider, this insurance could also include gas delivery, towing, and assistance if your yacht gets stranded.\nKey Takeaways\nYacht insurance provides indemnity liability coverage for a sailing vessel.\nIt has two principal parts: hull insurance and protection and indemnity (P&I) insurance.\nWhile there is no legal agreed upon length that separates a yacht from a pleasure boat, generally it is considered to be somewhere between 27 and 30 feet.\nUnderstanding Yacht Insurance\nSome companies specialize in providing coverage for antique and classic boats. You can choose between an\nactual cash value\nor\nagreed value\npolicy. The former is cheaper but factors in depreciation and market value, so your payout will be less.\nSome policies include discounts based on your boating education, safety features, and whether you have a hybrid or electric boat. Some companies also offer a\npackage deal\nthat decreases the rate on a yacht insurance policy if you purchase additional policies, such as for your home or car.\nBoats are defined as vessels under 197 feet long, while ships are 197 feet long or longer. There is no agreed upon\nlength for a yacht\n, but they are generally considered to be at least 30 feet long. A vessel under 27 feet is considered a pleasure boat.\nAlthough there isn't a standard definition of what the size of a yacht is, we can see that there is a general agreement within a range. With that being said, this general range falls within class 2 and class 3 of the Federal boat classification system.\nFor its own purposes, the National Boat Owners Association marks the dividing line at 27 feet. Most yacht coverage is broader and more specialized than pleasure boat coverage, because larger vessels travel farther and are exposed to greater risks.\nImportant\nYacht insurance is broader and more specialized than pleasure boat coverage, due to the fact that a yacht can sail farther and thus runs greater risks.\nA yacht insurance deductible, the amount of money you must pay out of your own pocket before your insurance kicks in, is usually a\u00a0percentage of the insured value. A 1% deductible, for example, means that a boat insured for $100,000 would have a $1,000 deductible. Most lenders allow a maximum deductible of 2%\u00a0of the insured value.\nGenerally, yacht insurance coverage does not include\u00a0wear and tear, gradual deterioration, marine life, marring, denting, scratching, animal damage, osmosis, blistering, electrolysis, manufacturer\u2019s defects, defects in design, and ice and freezing.\nTwo Parts of Yacht Insurance\nThere are two principal\u00a0sections\u00a0of a yacht insurance policy.\nHull insurance\nHull insurance is an all-risk, direct damage coverage that includes an agreed amount of hull coverage. That amount is settled on when the policy is written, and in the case of a total loss it will be paid out in full.\nIn addition, there is\nreplacement cost\ncoverage on partial losses, though sails, canvas, batteries, outboards, and sometimes outdrives are not include and instead are subject to depreciation.\nProtection and indemnity (P&I)\nProtection and indemnity (P&I) insurance is the broadest of all liability coverages, and because maritime law is particular, you will need coverages that are designed for those exposures. Longshore and harbor workers\u2019 coverage and\nJones Act\ncoverage (for the yacht\u2019s crew) are included and important, because your losses in these areas could run into six figures. P&I will cover any judgements against you and also pays for your defense in\nadmiralty courts\n.\nArticle Sources\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

However I think I can make this problem easier to solve by:\nSharing our own insurance experience over the nearly 30 years we were out there, much of it cruising high-risk places short-handed.\nProviding information on how marine insurance works and the current state of the market.\nSharing practical tips on how to secure offshore insurance and then maintain a good relationship with the covering company.\nActing as a repository in the comments for the experiences of, and tips from, the many AAC Members who are out there now or have been lately.\nYes, this is going to be long, and parts of it a bit boring, but it will also be worth your time if you really want to get out there.\nAnd, of course, the alternative option to searching out and paying for full hull and rig insurance is to either go without any insurance at all or with liability only, but\nColin explores that\n.\nLet\u2019s start with our experience:\nLogin to continue reading (scroll down).\nPaid membership required:\nLearn About Membership\nGet to know us for FREE\nUsername\nPassword\nRemember Me\nForgot Password\nMore Articles From Insurance:\nGetting Insurance For Offshore Voyaging\u2014Understanding The Problem\n29 Tips To Get Insurance For Offshore Voyaging\u2014Us and Our Boat\n29 Tips To Get Insurance For Offshore Voyaging\u2014Negotiating Cover\nGoing Without Insurance For Offshore Cruising?\nLogin\nLogin or Join Us To Comment\n93\nComments\nOldest\nNewest\nInline Feedbacks\nView all comments\nDick Stevenson\nJune 3, 2021 8:17 pm\nHi John,\nNice article, well presented.\nI will work up the details of my insurance, but another consideration that we bumped into (and it was a surprise in the small print) was that our prior insurance demanded crew (3 people) for an offshore passage. This caused us to change companies, but it took awhile to find one that would allow Ginger and I to passage alone.\nI think there is a lot to be said for buying liability alone and putting the amount boat insurance would cost every year into an acct. (that would earn some $$ sitting there) for repair/emergencies etc.\nMy best, Dick Stevenson, s/v Alchemy\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nDick Stevenson\nJune 4, 2021 7:11 am\nHi Dick,\nI agree that in the future liability only may be the best, or even only option for most cruisers.\nMarc Dacey\nReply\nJohn Harries\nJune 4, 2021 12:16 pm\nThis is essentially our tactic, although to be honest we have a fair deal of privilege even within the cruising fraternity to be able to afford a self-financed contigency of this sort. We\u2019ve met some significantly younger cruisers than ourselves in the last year and while it\u2019s heartening to see people with their natural hair colour achieving their cruising dreams, it is the \u201cperipheral costs\u201d such as insurance that are making that dream harder to achieve.\nKarl Coplan\nJune 4, 2021 9:54 am\nWe continue to have a good experience getting offshore coverage in the US from the Gowrie Group with their Jackline Policy underwritten by Markel.\nhttps://gowrie.com/pdfs/JacklineInsuranceProgram-2021NewsUpdates.pdf\nOne comment mentioned getting liability coverage only \u2013 are there any insurers that write liability only policies?\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nKarl Coplan\nJune 4, 2021 3:34 pm\nHi Karl,\nGreat to hear. Could you give us more details please. See the list under the request for comments on the post.\nOne thing that is really important is when you say \u201coffshore\u201d does you policy allow you to cross an ocean? Getting coverage to say 150 miles out is relatively easy, but the problems seem to occur when we want to do a real crossing say to Bermuda or Hawaii.\nKarl Coplan\nReply\nJohn Harries\nJune 5, 2021 11:14 am\nwe have done two RT transatlantics with this policy, and plan to take advantage of their global coverage for a circumnavigation starting next year. Our premium (with a $5k deductible) is about 3% or 4% of declared value. Northern hurricane season exclusion starts July 1. Two crew is allowed, Check out the link.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nKarl Coplan\nJune 5, 2021 12:54 pm\nHi Karl,\nThanks for the fill, really useful.\nBut OUCH! 3% or 4%! That\u2019s really expensive. The worst I got was 1.9%. The should let you do anything you want that that price. That said, good to see the exclusion start is later.\nMatt Marsh\nReply\nJohn Harries\nJune 7, 2021 3:20 pm\n4% of declared value\u2026. ouch indeed. Add one more point and you\u2019re on par with the cost to insure a trip from French Guiana to geostationary orbit!\nOur April Marine policy is 2.45% of declared value with a $1000 deductible. It is hugely dominated by the premium for the $2m liability component, as\nMaverick V\nis a relatively cheap boat. It\u2019s my understanding that the premium-as-a-percentage-of-value tends to taper off with more expensive boats, as the liability component of a $300k boat\u2019s policy is not significantly riskier than that of a $30k boat\u2019s policy, but the hull-and-rig component could potentially have to pay out 10x more.\nWe have limits of 40\u009d\u00b0N to 52\u00b0N and 100 miles offshore, along with a Nov. 30 \u2013 Apr 1 winter layup requirement. Our broker hinted that April Marine may be willing to extend the geographic area, but we haven\u2019t asked them to do so yet and I don\u2019t know if they would offer true offshore coverage. Unlike many underwriters, they were willing to cover the newly-acquired boat while she was on the hard having her survey punchlist items dealt with.\nLast edited 4 years ago by Matt Marsh\nAllan Gray\nReply\nJohn Harries\nJune 5, 2021 11:22 am\nHi\nWe used to be insured with IMIS from Maryland  who were taken over by the Gowrie Group a couple of years ago. We live in Canada but we could use the address of our marina in Plattsburgh NY for billing purposes. However once Gowrie took over  Markell would not accept an address only application, we had to either own property or show proof of US residency.

Is your system from a main stream vendor like Victron or Mastervolt or a DIY system? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know DIY done right can be safe, but I\u2019m interested in the details from the insurance point of view.\nChris Jacques\nReply\nkevin millett\nJuly 4, 2021 9:57 am\nFollowing this one closely. With reference to the lithium comment\u2026 we were insured with the Jackline policy for two years on our last boat. During our present lengthy refit with a new (more valuable) vessel we\u2019re limited to coastal cruising and just wanted to get some initial coverage. So when working out a new policy with the broker (Gowrie) we were told: 1. that our new LiFePo setup would not be allowed in any case. 2. they would only insure to the boat price we paid (pre-refit), regardless of the appraisal/ survey value, which varies by a very large amount. Arguing this aspect didn\u2019t help, and we just accepted a sub-par policy for now. Looking forward to shopping again next year. Thanks for hosting this informative topic!\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nChris Jacques\nJuly 5, 2021 7:58 am\nHi Chris,\nThanks for that report, how annoying! Crazy after all the work of a refit, but, I fear, not unusual.\nSame question, is yours a complete system from a company like Mastervolt or  Victron or a DIY set up? I\u2019m just trying to get a handle on what is triggering the insurance company refusal.\nStein Varjord\nReply\nJohn Harries\nJuly 5, 2021 1:12 pm\nHi John,\nI\u2019ve been hearing gradually more stories about companies denying insurance by hearing the word \u201clithium\u201d, with zero interest for what chemistry or build type type they are. My impression is that they are on a knee jerk type reaction pattern, with very little or no thinking or knowledge behind it.\nSince the same companies have absolutely no qualms about phones, tablets, laptops and rechargeable tools being loaded into the boat, while they don\u2019t accept a LiFePo4 (LFP) type house bank with lots of safety systems integrated, it proves there is no actual logic or statistics behind their reaction.\nThe actual provable facts is that the batteries in household electronics and tools are at least 10 times as likely to have a critical fault and that such a fault in an LFP house bank is almost impossible to turn into a fire. The normal worst case is quite a lot of heat and (poisonous) smoke, but no actual fire. The far more normal critical reaction is just swelling of the cells and then it stops. Expensive, but not dangerous. The LiCo, LiMn and other batteries in household electronics will, if they do indeed have a critical failure, normally go into a white hot blazing fire that will ignite anything within reach.\nEven though this type of event can indeed happen (not with LFP), it is of course extremely rare. If not, these battery types would not have been so much used. After having educating myself on this topic for several years, I have absolutely no worries about having these batteries aboard. It\u2019s smart, of course, to treat them with respect and care. Perhaps it\u2019s even good to have a specific place for them, but we shouldn\u2019t be too paranoid, I think\u2026.\nHowever, it would be great if it was possible to get some awareness into the insurance companies\u2026.\nLast edited 4 years ago by Stein Varjord\nMatt Marsh\nReply\nkevin millett\nDecember 9, 2024 4:14 pm\nI had a chat with our insurer (McDougall as broker, April Marine underwriting) about this recently. The underwriter said that they would probably consider an LFP battery installation that complies with ABYC E-11 and E-13 to be OK but cannot say \u201c100% yes\u201d without a survey. Like everyone else, they\u2019re not terribly interested in insuring anything that\u2019s not standards-compliant.\nE-13 is not without its flaws, but formalizing it as a minimum benchmark seems to have made the underwriters a lot more comfortable with lithium. The surveyor can say \u201cit needs X and Y fixed to meet ABYC E-13\u201d and the underwriter can reply \u201cOK, show us proof that X and Y are fixed and then we can cover it.\u201d\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nMatt Marsh\nDecember 10, 2024 9:28 am\nHi Matt,\nThanks for doing that, and very good to hear that they were open to lithium, rather than just slamming the door at the mention of the word, as has happened in the past.\nHillary Horn\nJune 4, 2021 10:50 am\nIn my business we have begun to delve deeply into group insurance and insurance captives as a way to reduce costs and avoid getting locked out a market. Basically a group of businesses coming together to manage the float, the claims, share risk for smaller claims and buy reinsurance for larger claims. I wonder if that might be possible with like minded sailors. Think of what you have paid in premiums over the years and your claim history.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nHillary Horn\nJune 4, 2021 3:41 pm\nHi Hillary,\nI agree, that\u2019s a great idea. I have long thought that a group like the CCA or the OCC should look at setting up captive or \u201cinsurance club\u201d as the shipping companies did years ago. Bermuda would be a great domicile for that.\nA good friend of mine ran Steamship Mutual\u2019s office in Bermuda for years.\nMatt Marsh\nReply\nJohn Harries\nJune 7, 2021 10:30 pm\nAbsolutely. This is a pretty clear case of large players in a large market failing to understand a small specialized market segment. Even though the risk of offshore voyaging is statistically well understood, and amenable to insurance and reinsurance, we are lacking a global player with a sufficient concentration of expertise to make the product viable.\nThe obvious solution is to create that concentration of expertise, build a firm around it, and put an insurance product on the market that fills this niche.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nMatt Marsh\nJune 8, 2021 8:03 am\nHi Matt,\nYes, just the reason that shipping companies form their own insurance \u201cclubs\u201d.

At that time IMIS (International Marine Insurance Services) with Al Golden (a cruiser himself) was the go-to ins co for many SSCA members and we felt that they would do right by any claims if only to forestall bad press that would end up in SSCA members laps. We had no claims in 20+ years and the few claims I know of were handled well by IMIS.\nWell, the company evolved, I do not know if a Golden is still involved, and it is now owned by the Gowrie Group.\nWe now have a policy that does not include offshore passage making, but when we did, almost all passage making was just the 2 of us and there were few limits. The times we needed riders were when we were going somewhere unusual: Middle East countries of Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Egypt needed a rider. Above 62 degrees latitude in Norway and the trip back to North America via Iceland and Greenland.\nThese riders were easy for us to obtain (write out a not-unreasonably expensive check) and I do not remember whether our good track record for claims played a part, but I suspect it did.\nI never considered IMIS ins to be a bargain and almost pulled the plug to go to Pantaneous who gave quotes~~20% less expensive, but never was comfortable with the stability of Pantaneous and their policies.\nMy best, Dick Stevenson, s/v Alchemy\nDavid McKay\nJune 5, 2021 9:18 am\nJohn,\nThank you for a good first cut on a challenging subject. I do not have a background in marine insurance but was an aviation underwriter for close to forty years. The aviation market in fact grew out of the marine market and they remain remarkably similar today. I believe the market drivers to be the same for both with some variation, and in many cases the risk capital for each comes from several of the same sources. Here a few points of clarification to consider:\n1.\nInsurance is a cyclical business.\nThe insurance cycle is primarily driven by capacity and profitability. Despite global warming, I would suggest that there were likely few insurance complaints between 2009 and 2018. That period represented one of the deepest and most protracted \u201csoft\u201d markets in decades. Insurance capacity was plentiful, and those who had it wanted it deployed and were looking for a return. Insurance does not have a unique economic response to over-supply; underwriting terms loosen, and rates and premiums become more and more competitive. Eventually, though, rates get so low that they no longer support profitability. Add a catastrophe or two (witness Irma 2017), and insurers withdraw to focus on more profitable lines of insurance. As profitability returns to the market through proper underwriting and sustainable pricing, capacity returns and the cycle begins anew.\nTo your point on global warming, some hard-won learning may influence the look and shape of the eventual recovery, however, like better managing aggregated exposure in catastrophe locations, such as the Caribbean, for example.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Underwriting discipline vs. investment returns\nThe defining characteristic of one insurers\u2019 profitability over another is generally not investment returns, but rather the company\u2019s commitment to underwriting discipline. One an underwriter has complete control over, the other, not so much. As a friend in the business once told me, \u201cHope is not a good business plan.\u201d\nUnderwriting profitability is measured in the business by an insurer\u2019s Combined Ratio which is its Loss Ratio plus its Expense Ratio. Insurer\u2019s can be more profitable, even in a lousy investment environment, by doing a better job of underwriting and pricing risks and reducing its underwriting expense.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation\nIn the United States the McCarren-Furguson Act of 1945 gives the states the authority to regulate the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d without interference from federal regulation. Consequently, an \u201cadmitted\u201d insurer, regardless of where they do business from, are necessarily licensed in each state where they conduct (insurance) business.\nSo likely it is less about where the insurer corporately resides and more likely about where and how the insurer in question decides to be licensed to sell insurance. This, as you suggest, is a much bigger subject than I represent here but the crux is that it\u2019 is probably not a country thing.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Managing General Agencies (MGAs) and Joint Underwriting Authorities (JUAs)\nMGAs and JUA\u2019s are similar, but not the same. I would suspect that Pantaenius America Ltd. was a Joint Underwriting Authority and not a broker. Basically, a JUA underwrites risks, manages claims, buys reinsurance, and functions like an actual insurance company, but the risks it assumes are on behalf of a group of otherwise unrelated insurance companies. A JUA may represent a specialty segment of the insurance market that the individual insurance companies would like to participate in, but not spend the time or resources to build-out on their own. It looks like the three insurance companies who provided risk capital to Pantaenius America Ltd. were:\nAllianz Global Corporate & Specialty (Germany)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a060%\nBerkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a030%\nMarkel American Insurance Company\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010%\nLikely, the reason you though Pantaenius placed you with Berkshire Hathaway was that it may have been listed as the licensed \u201cissuing\u201d company for the policy, but all three members were still exposed to your risk to the extent they participated in Pantaenius; 60%, 30%, and 10%.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brokers and Agents \u2013 A distinction with a difference\nBrokers are licensed insurance professionals who represent the insured, not the insurer. Brokers have access to the entire insurance marketplace and trade with, on behalf of their clients, those markets they have relationships with.\nAgents, on the other hand, are generally employees of and only represent a singular insurance company \u2013 think Allstate.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quota-Share Insurance Placements and Lead Underwriters\nUnlike a JUA, where a management company manages the underwriting on behalf of the (member) insurance companies, a licensed broker may place an individual risk with various insurance companies (or syndicates) by a quota-share of the total. Not all markets have the scope or capability to produce policy wording or handle claims, so the broker chooses one that does to act as the underwriting or claims \u201clead\u201d to handle those things on behalf of the 100% placement. The following markets on the placement generally agree to follow the lead\u2019s terms and support its claims decisions. Brokers may also create (quota-share) \u201cschemes\u201d (a British term that always seemed to me to only confirm how retail customers think all insurance is transacted) with a selection of underwriters to place a group of homogeneous risks. Such schemes of insurance generally do have an underwatering and claims lead and customer participation often relies upon a devise such as membership, but access is open to the broader broker community on behalf of their individual clients. I would suspect that Pantaenious America Ltd. was neither a broker nor an insurance scheme created by a broker, but instead a JUA or the like.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Good Broker\nAn underwriter generally commits itself to the first submitting broker and reports to other brokers who contact them after the initial contact that they are \u201cblocked\u201d. To do otherwise would be to ruin relationships that the business depends on to function. Ultimately, it is the insured\u2019s decision on what broker they wish to represent them. Markets require a formal \u201cbroker of record\u201d letter if they wish to make a change to make that intention clear. It may happen accidentally, but in the main, underwriters do not change their terms, even with new information, for the newly appointed broker. To do otherwise would be unfair, rightly or wrongly, to the original submitting broker. \u00a0Your point is a good one though \u2013 do some research to find the best broker fit the first time, understanding that once a market commits to terms, it most likely will take a policy year to undo.\nHope some of these are helpful clarifications and thanks again.\nCheers,\nDave\nMarc Dacey\nReply\nDavid McKay\nJune 5, 2021 2:19 pm\nVery helpful, indeed, in that it covers off the somewhat opaque relationships and risk-sharing in the insurance industry and clarifies who is your \u201cfriend\u201d in this transaction, which is important for those buying this product to understand. This is top-of-mind as I just switched policies for a currently distant rental property we own after an unreasonable 40% jump in cost. Like the more wide-ranging policies offshore cruisers seek, it\u2019s a small market  without a lot of choice to insure a house in which the owners have never lived, but in which many of their possessions are stored.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nDavid McKay\nJune 6, 2021 8:19 am\nHi David,\nGreat stuff and just what I hoped to get from an insider, thank you so much.\nA couple of comments:\nUnderwrite Discipline\n: While I hear you on underwriting discipline, I was told by several insiders in Bermuda at the time that a big problem for those trying to maintain that discipline was the newbie companies that flooded into the market just looking for investment returns, and further that this was, at least in their eyes, the primary reason for over capacity and further that the drop in returns with the associated shake out of the newbies was the primary reason that underwriters were able to apply more discipline. That said, the insiders were in catastrophe reinsurance business, so I may have been wrong to apply it to marine.\nCountry restrictions:\nI was told by two brokers\u00a0and one lead underwriter that this was the reason they could no longer cover me. Several friends have been told the same thing. Of course that does not make it true!\nBrokers and Agents:\nThanks for the correction on that. I will fix it in the article.\nBrokers are licensed insurance professionals who represent the insured:\nI know that\u2019s the theory, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s true in your professional aviation world. And in fact one of my oldest friends and used-to-be-crew is one of the most respected brokers in the high end catastrophe reinsurance business and a total professional.\nThat said many of the brokers we run into these days in the yacht business are sadly anything but professional and since the market tightened many of they clearly don\u2019t give a damn about their clients and have totally forgotten that their job is to represent us, not suck up to the underwriters. Unreturned calls and emails as well as a take it or leave it attitude seems to be increasingly the norm. That said there are shining exceptions.\nPantaenius Broker or Not?\nI\u2019m reasonable sure that all of the Pantaenius offices\u00a0had no underwriting power and were/are just brokers. Or at least we\u2019re up until a few years ago.\nThis is based on doing business with three of their offices over nearly 30 years. In each case whenever I negotiated the answer was \u201cwe will check with the underwriters\u201d (not in house).\nAnd in one case (2005) I had direct dealings with the German market lead underwriter (long story) on a policy placed by Pantaenius America, so I\u2019m reasonable sure of my ground on that one.\nOf course that could have changed later to the structure you mentioned and in fact now I think about how things went down that would make sense. That said in my last dealing with the UK office seemed to indicate no underwriting capability in house, see the article.\nAnyway, interesting about those two structures and definitely something I had no idea about.\nBlocked:\nI have run into this, so good to have a better understanding of the the way it works and confirmation that running around a lot of brokers is not useful.\nLast edited 4 years ago by John Harries\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nDavid McKay\nJune 19, 2021 10:53 am\nHi David,\nYou were right about a different broker not being able to get better terms from a given underwriter. Based on your comment I dug into the situation that appeared to support my earlier assertion and found that I had been misinformed so I have struck that part from the article. Thanks again for the help.\nSteven Haver\nJune 5, 2021 4:08 pm\nHi John-\nWe were with Markel through Gowrie Group for a number of years, but dropped that coverage in 2020 due their coverage restrictions in Grenada, where we chose to stay during Covid.  We had to pay a rider for Grenada, plus have the boat hauled and strapped down.  This made for a very expensive hurricane season living on land!\nWe switched to Netherlands Grenada, who I believe is both the broker and underwriter. We pay a 2% annual premium for full coverage, plus personal effects, dinghy, etc.;  it is based on agreed value.\nWe have worldwide coverage with no navigation or crew restrictions (no chartering), and the 2% deductible doubles for a named storm.  When we were getting quotes last year, Anjou in Jolly Harbour has a similar policy and price point.  USA flagged vessel.  I would be happy to send you the policy documents.\nWe\u2019ll be shopping again this fall, so very much appreciate the in-depth coverage of the subject.\nSteve Haver\nS/V SoulShine\nSt. George\u2019s, Grenada\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nSteven Haver\nJune 6, 2021 8:01 am\nHi Steven,\nGreat information and particularly interesting that those two companies in the Caribbean were able to cover a US flagged boat.

As per Ted Simpers comments, I too have had tremendous service from Vera Young at Western Financial in Victoria BC. I met her on a chance walk in to their offices in 2014 just before buying Oh! my Leopard 40 Catamaran. The service has been excellent ever since. Premium this season was 2.5% of agreed hull value for East Coast USA and Bahamas. Included is a charter rider so I could run skippered \u201cexperience the cruising lifestyle charters\u201d, 50 % of which are open ocean passages; plus extended periods of solo offshore sailing ( deductible doubles when solo). The big one is the 20% deductible for named/ numbered windstorm damage\u2026needless to say Oh! is north of Cape Hatteras June 1-Dec. 1 each year.\nFrom what I have learned from other owners and competing quotes, my coverage is great- especially WRT solo coverage. So far Oh! and I have done 5 significant solos 600 -1800 nmi., mostly from Caribbean back to the USA but also a trans-Atlantic 3 years ago. So it has been well used.\nOne note re-solo coverage. Vera explained that the risk that most concerned the underwriters was my age. I was 61 when it was first granted. Their concern was exposure to possible health emergencies while at sea. What helped her convince the underwriters was that she and I had met in person each year over the previous 3 years and she could personally convey her confidence in my apparent health. The point is \u2013 get to know your broker and try hard to meet them in person. Also, keep your broker informed throughout the year regarding conducting your sailing adventures and conduct within the limits of the policy terms \u2013 overtime that relationship can yield huge benefits\nI am looking forward to Part 2!\nCheers\nRod Morris\nSV Oh!\nhttp://www.cloudstocoral.com\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nRodney Morris\nJune 6, 2021 8:06 am\nHi Rodney,\nThis is great information, thank you. Do you have any idea who the underwriters are? It should be on your policy. I\u2019m really interested to find out since every other Canadian I know who has approached a Canadian broker has been offered very expensive and limited cover underwritten at Lloyds. I\u2019m hoping she has put together something better.\nRodney Morris\nReply\nJohn Harries\nJune 6, 2021 3:27 pm\nHI, The policy indicates it is Global Yacht Cover effected through Alwen Hough Johnson Limited on behalf of ERGO Versicherung AG. Also, a side note to the solo coverage; I was in Bermuda thinking about the passage to the Azores and asked what the premium was for solo insurance \u2013 she indicated she doubted she could get it. So I left without insurance. Four days later while communicating via IridiumGo! she was surprised to learn I had left without coverage. Two days after that she informed me she had obtained coverage, the only change was a doubling of the deductible \u2013 no additional premium was required but I was required to have a AIS transponder operating, which I had \u2013 now that is service! The remainder of the voyage was covered and I have not had any issues getting solo insurance with Global Yacht Cover since.\nBy the way as a comparison, 4 out of 5 other quotes I have obtained over the past years have all required at least 4 crew (including myself), all with prior offshore experience and their sailing resume\u2019s submitted for the underwriters approval before they would grant offshore coverage. That just doesn\u2019t work for me. Too many crew and far to much hassle to deal with.\nCheers\nLast edited 4 years ago by Rodney Morris\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nRodney Morris\nJune 7, 2021 8:40 am\nHi Rodney,\nGreat information. As I suspected Vera is going through a UK broker to place cover in the German insurance market.\nI was hoping that she had found a Canadian underwriter, but there we are, at least you have cover and with sensible terms, albeit at a stiff price.\nA friend of mine here in Nova Scotia is covered the same way, so at least we know there is an option for Canadians.\nAlan Sexton\nJune 6, 2021 5:42 am\nHi John,\nHere is some perspective from NZ.\nI insure through Baileys who one of the best known brokers in NZ for marine insurance \u2013 Neil Bailey is an experienced yachtie. They have placed my yacht\u2019s insurance with Vero(an Australian insurer) over the last few years.\nIn preparation for my 2019 Sth Pacific cruise I asked Bailey\u2019s to arrange offshore insurance. Coverage on top of my coastal policy comprised:\ntop up premium of ~1% insured value\n$17k excess\nBoat builder\u2019s out of water inspection\nRig inspection\nseasonal coverage only, departing early May, back in NZ by mid Nov\nMinimum 3 crew for passages to/from NZ, with sailing CV\u2019s to be submitted for review. Interestingly this did not apply to interisland passages, I sailed from Vanuatu to New Cal single handed and had prior confirmation coverage was maintained\nOn top of the above, being a NZ vessel we have to obtain a Cat 1 safety certificate as a prerequisite to depart.\nSince then the local market has tightened up significantly. Club Marine, an Australian group (not sure who their underwriter is) has exited the NZ market. I have seen my premium and excess for my coastal cover bumped due to the boat being over 30 yrs old and value changed from agreed to market value (unless I get a formal valuation and pay an additional premium). Bailey\u2019s have further advised that, while existing policies will be honoured, Vero is not writing any new policies for boats over 30yrs old. It all comes back to the companies not making any profit, in part due to their own negligence of not doing proper due diligence on what they are insuring \u2013 been quite a few claims in the past on grossly over valued boats.\nWe can still get offshore cover but it is becoming much tougher.\nAlso I understand that the big change is that Lloyds are no longer underwriting pleasure boat insurance.\nNZ boats seem to have a bit of a stigma in the international market, unsure why. A friend bought a yacht in Spain 2 yrs ago to sail back to NZ. Had a great deal of difficulty getting coverage, he said as soon as he said NZ registered vessels most companies did not want to know.

Just shows there is no logic to this.\nI guess the other side of the coin is that when you guys do go somewhere else the first passage is a tough one with a bad reputation for losses.\nAlan Sexton\nReply\nJohn Harries\nJune 7, 2021 5:16 pm\nHi John,\nI came across this column by Neil Bailey, it\u2019s a year old but still very pertinent.\nhttps://www.sailsouthpacific.com/news/insurance-update-the-new-norm/\nRe your closing comments, in general it is the getting back to NZ that is typically more problematic. Leaving you wait for the right weather scenario and go as fast as you can to get north, eg the group of yachts that left NZ for Fiji last Tuesday did. The Youtubing Wynn\u2019s are experiencing the challenges of the passage to NZ right now, see\nhttps://forecast.predictwind.com/tracking/display/Curiosity\n(I would not want to be out in the current conditions in their cat with all its maintenance issues)\nAs for \u201cbad reputation for losses\u201d, although we have of course had our losses from time to time, the most recent being the tragic loss of Essence in 2019, I think you will find the actual numbers are no worse than say for Atlantic crossings.\ncheers\nAlan\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nAlan Sexton\nJune 8, 2021 8:01 am\nHi Alan,\nGreat blog by Bailey, thanks for the link.\nAs to the Wynn\u2019s I got interested and took a look at the models, and it looks like they will get away without much of a dusting, so should be fine as long as the boat is well found. That said your comment about \u201cmaintenance issues\u201d was concerning.\nAnd yes I agree that the losses in your area are probably just perception, that said I have long learned that it seems that perceptions are what drive many insurance underwriters, not reality. In fact I would bet big that the losses per passage mile are way higher in the annual migration south from the North American east coast. At least for the passage to and from Fiji the boats are either somewhat experienced by getting to Fiji or have gone through the NZ safety inspection.\nMurray Fitzgerald\nJune 6, 2021 10:17 am\nAlan mentioned Club Marine \u2013 owned by Alianz who are the underwriters. We use Club Marine and are very happy with them. Had a claim about 12 years ago with no problems however they may have recovered their costs. We are insured for the total boat \u2013 i.e. hull & rigging, tender etc and solo sailing to 250nm off shore. They required my experience, quals. etc plus a survey at the time of purchase. Cost is 0.94% of agreed value. I have discussed my planned NZ cruise with them and there will be additional costs if I want cover for the ditch but I am already covered when within NZ waters. Sounds like I should be happy.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nMurray Fitzgerald\nJune 7, 2021 8:32 am\nHi Murry,\nThat sounds good indeed. Of course you don\u2019t have true offshore insurance at that price, but given that they will cover you in NZ your comment highlights a good option of having cover when coastal but going liability only offshore, or even no insurance at all, particularly since I firmly believe a well found boat is safest well offshore.\nWilson Fitt\nJune 6, 2021 6:55 pm\nHi John\nThanks for taking on an important and difficult topic.\nBack in 1999 when we were finishing construction of our boat here in Nova Scotia and planning a trip south, I enquired about insurance through a local broker. I think I could hear the laughter fifty kilometers away. \u201cYou have never built a boat or sailed offshore before, yet you want us to insure a wooden boat that you just finished for a trip to the Caribbean!!!\u201d\nWe ended up taking our chances, went without, and with care and a lot of luck did not damage ourselves, our boat or anyone else\u2019s.\nOn arrival back home we arranged coverage through the same local broker underwritten by Royal Sun Alliance that covers roughly from New York to Cape Bauld and a modest distance offshore.\nA few years later when I headed translatlantic singlehanded, I decided that the risks were mostly near the rocky bits at the edges and did not seek insurance while at sea. Pantaneous seemed very willing to offer insurance for the three years we were in Scotland and Ireland. No damage done and no claims made so, apart from cost, it was a painless experience. local coverage was resumed when we got home.\nIn 2020 we were planning to head across again and found that Pantaneous was uninterested. I received a quote from Dolphin Insurance at a premium of $3,075 for $150,000 hull and equipment coverage, $1M liability, $2,500 deductible. This comes to 2% according to my calculator. The underwriter was ERGO Versicherung AG. Again, this did not include losses at sea but provided coverage for coastal Nova Scotia, Ireland, UK, Norway to 60 north, Baltic, France and points in between.\nThat voyage was cancelled by Covid so we are still sailing home waters and planning a trip to Newfoundland this summer, reasonably content in the knowledge that most people would give their eye teeth to be able to do what we can.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nWilson Fitt\nJune 11, 2021 8:15 am\nHi Wilson,\nThanks for the report. Interesting that Dolphin placed your risk in the German market and I think quoted mine placed in the UK. Clearly my mistake was not asking for one that excluded the ocean bit. Good to hear that was an option.\nRob Ramsey\nJune 8, 2021 1:10 pm\nGreat discussion John, thanks. I am a little puzzled though. I would have thought the risky bits are near the hard parts, not so much the open ocean. And yet, I get insurance for Europe till 10 miles out of the coast for som 0.6% of agreed value \u2013 dirt cheap, so I gather. Going to the UK (from The Netherlands) the most risky part are the UK banks, well within the 10 NM range. The middle part is easy (busy, but easy) and a collision with a tanker while sailing would not fall on my insurer.\nGuess I\u2019m asking: why not cover coastal en do oceanic passages without insurance? Not much risk there \u2026\nLast edited 4 years ago by Rob Ramsey\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nRob Ramsey\nJune 8, 2021 2:44 pm\nHi Rob,\nSure, you could do that and it would in many ways make perfect sense. In fact you will see me writing about that option in a comment reply further up.\nThat said, many people (most?) want to have their boat insured for ocean passages so this article, and the next, are for them.\nAlso, as far as I know it\u2019s not that easy to get one underwriter to cover you for the coastal parts at both ends of a trip, but not the middle.\nBrian Russell\nJune 10, 2021 8:14 am\nWe got our 44\u2032 alloy sloop insured through Gowrie/ Markel.Unlimited offshore between Bergen and Falklands latitudes, 2 handed okay, named storm exclusion 7/1-11/15 between 10\u02d9N and 31\u02d9 N, however boat is still covered for other incidents in this time and area, just not named storms. Agreed Value, looks like 1.5% premium, 3% deductible except named storms higher. Glad to have it, seems very reasonable to us.\nMike Evans\nJune 10, 2021 8:48 am\nWe have had some luck getting quotes for our 2006 Najad 405 to cross from Newfoundland to the Azores and UK/EU. Most required that we replace the standing rigging which is original to the boat. One broker is willing to exclude cover on the Selden mast and rig, we plan to replace the standing rig in Sweden. Another we found would cover us once we arrived in the UK, no Azores or crossing cover. Today we\u2019re sitting her in NL waiting for updated quotes to come from the brokers, we think we\u2019ll go either with no crossing insurance or no rig cover. They seem to be our best options at the moment. Both of these brokers have quoted $C which is nice too.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nMike Evans\nJune 11, 2021 8:18 am\nHi Mike,\nThanks for the report, while I can see going without for the crossing I have real reservations about going with no rig cover. My worry is that if the mast went over the side and then the boat was lost, as often happens, they might disallow the whole claim on the basis that it started with a dismasting. The wording I got on the Dolphin quote, see above, would definitely let them pull that one.\nIf so, one would, in effect be paying a premium for nothing.\nLast edited 4 years ago by John Harries\nTerence Thatcher\nJune 19, 2021 1:25 am\nFor our 2016-2017 trip to Central America and home to Oregon through Hawaii, we got a Jackline Policy, agreed value, using broker International Marine Insurance, underwritten by Markel American Insurance.  When we decided to go to Polynesia, they agreed to that, as I recall, without a price increase. Hull Insurance was 3.3% of agreed value, 10% deductible, with value based on the required survey.  No personal liability, since I have a sizeable liability policy from another firm for all risks.  Tropical storms exclusion in certain latitudes and dates, altho curiously, not if you are in Hawaii. Exclusion for sailing below 50 degrees south and above 61 degrees north and near the east horn of\nAfrica. Many countries excluded (eg. Nicaragua, Cuba, Philippine, several in west Africa), but I got the impression one could get coverage in some of those places on request and for some money.No solo sailing; at least two persons aboard. $500,000 coverage for environmental damage, which is only half of my current BoatUS coverage for US and Canada cruising. IMIS was easy to deal with and helpful.  I think many members of Seven Seas Cruising Club use their services.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nTerence Thatcher\nJune 19, 2021 9:03 am\nHi Terence,\nThanks for the detailed report. Do you have any more recent experience? I ask because it seems that the offshore insurance market has tightened up a lot in the last three years.\nWim Vandenbossche\nJune 19, 2021 7:06 am\nIn response to your e-mail requesting input.\nInsured with Panteanius UK \u2013 underwriters are a consortiom of German underwriters.\nPremium is 1.25% of insured value. Though I did opt for various additional policies (travel, legal, health) which are extra.\nFull rig insurance\nThe policy is for an agreed/fixed value. I did have to provide a surveyor valuation report in evidence as the boat\u2019s 44 years old.\nCruising area suits my needs at the moment (North Sea, North Atlantice, Norwegian and Baltic Sea). This can be altered by prior arrangement as and when required.\nThey inquired about qualifications/experience and what I could submit seemed to satisfy them (Retired naval officer, RYA YM, 25+ years as a boat owner).\nPantaenius were the only company I could find that did not place restrictions on singlehanded sailing. As 90% of my sailing is singlehanded this was the deciding factor for me. Other brokers I contacted were able to come up with cheaper quotes but placed an 18-24 hour limit on singlehanded passages, which would have severly restricted my sailing.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nWim Vandenbossche\nJune 19, 2021 9:07 am\nHi Wim,\nThanks for the great report.

I have been considering a similar discussion at The CCA but perhaps I should simply refer members to Attainable Adventure?\nI have heard that GEICO is non-renewing clients that come to them via brokers but not those who go directly to GEICO.\nThe idea of an insurance \u201cclub\u201d is interesting although I agree with your sense that the market may be too small. A good friend is chair of a marine insurance \u201cclub\u201d \u2013 I will explore the idea. There may be a more practical way to accomplish the same thing without setting up a new \u201cclub\u201d, e.g. by helping a broker build a dominant position in the yacht market?\nMy coverage is:\nAgent: Marsh\nUnderwriter: Chubb/Ace\nPrice: 0.7% ins value (Agreed Value) + $281 for $500K liability (I have a separate umbrella policy)\nDeductible: 2% \u2013 windstorm deductible \u201cNot Applicable\u201d, $250 for electronics-only loss\nNav limits:\ncoastwise\nAtlantic from St. John\u2019s NB to Bahamas, exc not south of Georgia 1 July-1 Nov\nLayup 1 Nov \u2013 1 May\nI had to have a survey before coverage last year. Rig is <10 years old.\nI understand that I may extend the nav limit to include Newfoundland but I will need to provide a sailing resume for one experienced crew in addition to me.\nI formerly insured via Pantaenius which was otherwise fine until 2018 but they wouldn\u2019t cover St. Petersburg, Russia so I switched to Global Yacht Cover/ERGO via Topsail which was also fine but, when my boat returned to the US they couldn\u2019t cover here.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nErnest Godshalk\nJune 20, 2021 8:46 am\nHi Ernest,\nGood to hear from you. I have long thought that if the CCA really wants to regain relevance in today\u2019s world the two issues to really make an effort on are offshore insurance and the challenge of buying a reasonably priced and well designed offshore voyaging boat, like the A40, so anything you can do to get the leadership to engage on those two issues would be good I think.\nAnd thanks for your report. Really highlights how much more reasonable insurance is if we are willing to accept inshore only. Typically half the cost or less. I have had the same experience.\nDan Perrott\nJune 19, 2021 8:28 pm\nA useful article, I have a better understanding than before on how the game works.\nCurrently we don\u2019t have true offshore insurance since we are in the Caribbean but maybe this is still helpful.\nOur insurance was arranged through offshore risk management. It is with London Marine, their name on the policy.\nUnderwriters are: Selecta insurance and reinsurance company (Carribbean)\nCost is 3.7% hull value. (Agreed)\nCovers Caribbean and we must be out of the box to be covered by a named storm in hurricane season.\nSingle handing possible with an extra add on. No more than 250 miles offshore. Although I think this can also be modified changed if required.\nWe started with pantanius UK, who then decided our boat was too cheap, then Topsail, who 12 months later decided the same.\nToo cheap was I think about sub \u00a390k.\nWe are well under this.\nThe UK brokers we tried first couldn\u2019t find us anything and we were close to going liability only.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nDan Perrott\nJune 20, 2021 8:37 am\nHi Dan,\nGreat report, that exposes another issue: many underwriters seem only interested in expensive boats.\nAlso that pricing is not linear in that 3.7% is very high, but then again, in actual dollar terms not so much for a less expensive boat.\nThanks very much.\nAndre Langevin\nJune 20, 2021 11:33 am\nDisclaimer: Canadian boat and canadian captain.   Others are lucky with boat insurance (for the moment)\nGreat article in line with my knowledge (i worked many years in insurances companies) and with my experience trying to get boat insurance in the last 30 years.   But it was easy and reasonable up to a few years ago.  As John said everything crumbled 2 years ago..but especially for Canadians.  Not enough boating population and the brokers can live with 99% of the people keeping their boat in marina.\nUp to now our boat has been insured for local waters for about .5% of the agreed value.  All Canadians waters up to NY, USA and 150 nm of coast.\nFrom September 2020 to March 2021 in preparation for ocean navigation going to Antilles i contacted nearly all brokers on the planet to try to get insurance for the voyage later this autumn and staying in the Antilles for the winter.   The only one responding was Skipper Plans in Ontario where I could get a policy with Aviva for 15000 $CAD (3% of agreed value) but requirement for 3 persons aboard.   Dolphin declined also but offered us a 2 M$ liability only (500 k$ in US) for about 991 $CAD.\nFinally i got covered with Edward Williams capable of going to Bermuda and Antilles up to 500 nm from coast and farther if we wish. Single handed supported,  deductible going up if named stormed, a no sue clause that force negotiation if there is a claim etc\u2026   About 1% of the agreed value of the boat.  But i added the Dolphin liability,  better two than one. I can lose the boat,  but losing all my earnings is another thing.\nONLY CONCERN is that EdwardWilliams is underwritten by ION and these are Costa Rica insurers.  I live in Canada and barely knows all the commercial laws of my own country,  less the Costa Rica commercial laws.   So if there is a problem we are stuck.  This seems though a serious company that insures airplanes and boats and other high risk activity.\nBut we are in 2021 and i don\u2019t see the market getting better it will only get worse for years to come so i have to get used to this.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nAndre Langevin\nJune 21, 2021 6:17 am\nHi Andre,\nGreat report, although not good news, thank you!

I will detail more in my next post on the subject.\nRalph Keitel\nJuly 2, 2021 3:24 pm\nHi John,\nThanks for this very helpful article. After reading this, and several other similar articles, I\u2019ve now come to conclusion that, as a new cruiser (with limited offshore experience and having never owned my own boat) I may as well give up on the idea of obtaining hull insurance for the boat that I plan to buy next  year\nas I\u2019ll never be able to meet the requirements (esp. as crew is just me+1). So i\nnstead of spending $300K for boat, I\u2019ll downsize to $150K and keep the rest as reserve in case first one ends up on the rocks\u2026\nWhich brings me to the question: what is the alternative here? I read a lot about only obtaining liability insurance. When I spoke to Geico and Allstate (both of which agree to underwrite but only coastal cruising policy, i.e. not offshore) they said they don\u2019t do liability-only. I gather this is not representative, i.e. others do?\nAnd secondly: IF I can obtain liability-only insurance, what does that mean for me in terms of limitations i.e. what I can do/where I can go? I understand liability insurance is must have for most, or all, marinas as well as some (or all?) foreign countries I would wish to visit. Or is hull insurance required for either of these? Any other limitations when sailing with liability insurance only?\nThanks, Ralph\nMarc Dacey\nReply\nRalph Keitel\nJuly 2, 2021 5:56 pm\nIn my research, I have found to date that \u201cliability-only\u201d is not restrictive to most locales, as the typically $2 million in coverage will cover a lot of diesel spillage and hull hoisting should the worst case occur.\nOf course, in high latitudes,even that may be harder to obtain.\nBut it does mean for liveaboards a total loss of home and possessions and suggests that such cruisers would be more cautious about what they bring aboard if they cannot afford to lose it. This makes cruising a less egalitarian pursuit  if  it starts with the assumption that you have to have a spare boat\u2019s worth of cash around to cross an ocean. Most of the inspirational sailors of my acquaintance have been far from rich.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nRalph Keitel\nJuly 3, 2021 7:51 am\nHi Ralph,\nI have a wrap up article in the works that should answer most of your questions. As to a source for liability only, check through the comments above as I think at least a couple of members mentioned having it.\nLawrence Green\nJuly 4, 2021 2:00 am\nHi John,\nWe crossed the Pacific in 2017 the premium was approximately 1.5% of hull value (agreed value) with a deductible of 2% of hull value.  The broker was Novamar in Sarasota FL, They currently list 14 firms as underwriters, however I believe in the past they were using a Berkshire Hathaway underwriter. They were able to accommodate a need to increase the liability coverage to $4,000,000 in order to meet New Zealand requirements.\n\u201cPermission is hereby granted for navigation in Pacific waters including the waters of the South Pacific\nIslands including Australia, and New Zealand. The insured boat must remain between 10 degrees\nnorth latitude and 50 degrees South Latitude and between 135 degrees West Longitude and 130\ndegrees East Longitude at all times. It is warranted the insured boat must remain between 25 degrees\nSouth Latitude and 50 degrees South Latitude or between 10 degrees north latitude and 10 degrees\nsouth latitude from 15 November to 1 April, while between 180 degrees Longitude and 130 degrees\nEast Longitude\u201d m\nThe bad news was they could not meet the Australian requirements of $10 million AUD (about $7 million US) so we ended up shopping like crazy people in June of 2019.  Many things were learned, the most significant of which is many companies are limited in the cover they can write based on the flag of the vessel (US) and the passport of the owners (also US)\nThe folks at Topsail AU were the most helpful, referring us the their British office for help. Topsail in London is now our broker and the underwriter is a German company through a Lloyds syndicate.  In 2020 our premium was 1.4% of agreed value hull cover and the deductible was 2% of the hull cover.  The nav limits were Australian waters, including Tasmania (650 miles south of Sydney) The deductible is doubled for either a lightning strike or rig failure, and is 20% of the claim for damage related to a cyclone.  A significant incentive to avoid such storms.\nNeither of the described policies had any crew requirements, the current policy does require a bilge pump capable of 25 imperial gallons per minute to be installed and functioning.\nFinally, I agree whole heartedly with your comments about dealing with brokers and not pissing them off. In my experience I have been offered either a 1% or 2% deductible and have always gone for the higher number.  I beleive that does a couple of things that help, it actually lowers the risk to the underwriter and tells all involved they are not going to be nickeled and dimed by claims for ever mishap.  My view is this sort of insurance is to protect against the big things, and I will protect against the small things. Incidentally, this is a very timely topic, my wife, Charlene is admin on a foreign cruisers page in Australia, and literally dozens of people with no claims are getting non renewal notices.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nLawrence Green\nJuly 4, 2021 8:34 am\nHi Lawrence,\nGreat report, thanks so much. I totally agree with your views on deductibles.\nRandy C Tonkin\nJuly 7, 2021 8:54 pm\nYears ago my wife and I anticipated that insurance was going to be an expensive unavoidable obstacle and we set about talking to brokers and trying to figure out how to position ourselves to be more easily insured. We pursued off-shore and transoceanic experience and we assembled maritime credentials and certificates of pertinent training. I would be curious to learn what more would ease the risk concern with actuaries. In the boating world, we tend to think that experience counts for almost everything, and yet experienced people can still exhibit poor decision-making and make dumb mistakes.\nThis year we are commissioning a new Boreal 44 (The last of the 44s actually) . We shopped with many different recommended brokers, some of which are mentioned in this article, but found ourselves mostly getting jerked around, ignored, or denied. Finally we were able to engage a Global Yacht Cover policy (Alwen Hough Johnson Limited which is a Lloyd\u2019s Broker) through Topsail in the UK. They have provided coverage for vessels similar to ours. This is hull, rig and $1M liability for a US flagged vessel, coming in for around 1.4% of agreed value. The coverage includes Europe to Western Mexico excluding Venezuela, which meets our needs.\nHappily, GYC did not impart burdensome restrictions on crew number, qualification or experience, which I choose to understand that we have met their expectations in this regard. There is a single-handed clause which allows for one of us to operate solo for 24 of a given 36 hour period. Similar to Lawrence Green\u2019s experience, there was the weird 25 GPM bilge pump requirement, doubling of the deductible for lightning strikes and 10% of agreed value for all damage arising from named or numbered windstorms.\nPursuant to the discussion in this article, we will look to bumping up both the liability coverage and the deductible in our future policy shopping.\nHopefully this information is helpful for others;)\nRandy\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nRandy C Tonkin\nJuly 8, 2021 8:23 am\nHi Randy,\nGreat report, thanks. Looks like you were able to put together a very good deal, at least by the standards of the present market. I\u2019m guessing that much of the reason for the relatively good rate is because the boat is new. Any thoughts on that?\nChuck Batson\nAugust 4, 2021 4:11 pm\nMoments ago spoke with Gowrie Group and they will not even offer liability-only coverage unless the vessel surveys to a value of at least $100K, which mine will not. This was a complete shock to me, that a valuation limit might apply to liability-only! This is quite a predicament, because as you all know many places require liability coverage.\nAny other tips on obtaining liability-only insurance? I read the comments, but only one  gave specific information about liability-only (Dolphin) which I\u2019m now exploring. If I can\u2019t get liability-only that is going to be a real problem. \ud83d\ude41\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nChuck Batson\nAugust 5, 2021 8:04 am\nHi Chuck,\nThat\u2019s horrible, and just makes no sense at all.

(It is on the hard for 6 mos./ yr.)\nPolicy Form:\nDed. 5% of stated value (US$ 850,000)\nP& I Liab:  US$500,000  ( (I also carry a separate $5MM personal umbrella policy)\nNo crew reqmts (its just my wife and myself); single-handed cover avail for addit premium; rig is covered; coverage is replacement cost, not depreciated value; tender limit is US$2,500; Personal Property limit $5,000;\nmast is carbon fiber (we have had prior claims).\nI do have over 20,000nm offshore, including nearly 5,000nm single-handed, which may help the pricing.\nUnderwriter is ION, based in Costa Rica ($200MM surplus), placed thru London Marine Ins Services.  They are effectively an MGA and have the pen.  Will write UK and EU boats.  Boats over 30 years old may have additional underwriting reqmts (survey, etc.)\nPremium is .95% of stated value ($1MM or $2MM liab limits will of course be more).  I may need such limits this summer in EU.\nAgent is Don Spink @ Bluewater Insurance in Jupiter, FL\n(561) 743-3442.  He has been great, despite our prior claims history.\nHope this helps some of your other subscribers.\nJohn Lubimir\nApogee 58\ns/v Patriot\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nJohn Lubimir\nMay 11, 2022 7:34 am\nHi John,\nThat\u2019s great information and particularly useful considering how many of our members are having trouble securing the cover the need, thank you.\nAlso sounds like very reasonable terms.\nTom Bohanon\nSeptember 7, 2023 3:44 pm\nThis is all great info, John, and a big reason why I\u2019ve become a member of AAC.\nWe are currently trying to get insurance for a 1984 aluminum ketch that we\u2019ve recently purchased.  We had a pre-purchase survey done, but it unfortunately was rejected by all the insurance people I\u2019ve talked to (long story, but the surveyor wasn\u2019t SAMS/NAMS/ABYC certified).\nWe know we have a fair bit of work ahead of us (rewiring, as you mention in another article) to get the boat ready for a Northwest Passage bid, but I\u2019d like to get at least liability coverage in the short term and more extensive coverage next season.\nBeyond the rewiring, can you direct me to or offer any guidelines on what it takes to \u201cpass\u201d an insurance survey for basic coverage?  What are the minimum requirements to qualify for basic marine insurance (I\u2019ve asked, and can\u2019t get a straight answer from anybody)?  We\u2019d like to focus on that work first, so that we can get the haul out, rigging inspection and ultrasound done to a certified surveyors (and underwriters) satisfaction. Lastly, a\nre you or Colin aware of any companies that do actually offer just liability coverage? I think that would be fine for us at this stage.\nThanks for any ideas that you or other members may have on this.\nTom Bohanon\ns/v Quintette\nDick Stevenson\nReply\nTom Bohanon\nSeptember 7, 2023 4:15 pm\nHi Tom,\nI am not a big fan of surveyors, but\u2026\nI might consider interviewing a couple of surveyors locally (who meet the correct criteria), find one you feel you could work with and propose he/she tell you what needs to be done and supervise your doing the work to their satisfaction. With a good one, you are likely to learn a good deal about your new-to-you boat and they may enjoy the change from their usual routine.\nI would look for a surveyor who has experience with aluminum boats and one who supervises repairs on boats they survey for damage (usually, my take, far more knowledgeable than surveyors who just crank out pre-purchase and ins. surveys).\nRandom thought, good luck, Dick Stevenson, s/v Alchemy\nTom Bohanon\nReply\nDick Stevenson\nSeptember 11, 2023 7:15 pm\nHi Dick,\nGood ideas and suggestions\u2026thanks.  I  think that\u2019s the route we\u2019ll take for now (start with a consultation about what we need to do for a satisfactory insurance survey).  And, the guy I have in mind owns an aluminum boat of the same vintage, so that should help the process.\nBest,\nTom Bohanon\nDick Stevenson\nReply\nTom Bohanon\nSeptember 11, 2023 7:40 pm\nHi Tom,\nSounds like a plan. Retaining Colin was also a good suggestion. Good luck with it all, Dick\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nTom Bohanon\nSeptember 8, 2023 8:03 am\nHi Tom,\nThat\u2019s more than I can take on in a comment and I no longer do one on one consulting. So, given the size of the project, and the aggressive cruise you are planning I would recommend:\nRetain Colin to advise you through the project:\nhttps://www.morganscloud.com/consulting/\nJoin ABYC so you can download the requirements that will form the basis of any survey in North America.\nOn insurance, I don\u2019t know of any underwriters who will issue just liability coverage, but I would suggest going through the comments to these articles to see if there are any hints there.\nAnd here are my thoughts on The Northwest Passage:\nhttps://www.morganscloud.com/2014/10/09/enough-with-the-northwest-passage-already/\nTerence Thatcher\nJune 11, 2024 10:09 am\nIs there anything new on this issue?  Last December 2023 I was offered a Jackline Policy (same I have used before) from a place called Risk Strategies,subject to a survey.  I was about to get the survey (this week) and they told me the Jackline policy is no longer available.  The alternative was a policy only for boats with a value above $75K US.  I have massively upgraded my 45 year old Morgan 382 for offshore voyaging (most recently a new Beta 35), as well as its cosmetics.  But I know the market and no surveyor could honestly value it at $75K (my paint job was $55K).  Any new suggestions out there? Thanks.\nDick Stevenson\nReply\nTerence Thatcher\nJune 11, 2024 1:28 pm\nHi Terence,\nWhat a bummer. Insurance is so littered with landmines and caveats.\nI am close to pulling the plug on my present ins. For much the same reason and have heard good things about Gary Golden at Manifest Marine. He has a good pedigree as he is the son of Al Golden who started IMIS decades ago and catered to cruisers (his policies allowed passage making by a couple and did not demand extra crew for ex).\nI would give Gary a phone call: feel free to use my name as I have had a few conversations with him. And please get back to us with your impressions. And I would love to hear from anyone who has knowledge of Manifest Marine.\nMy best, Dick Stevenson, s/v Alchemy\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nTerence Thatcher\nJune 13, 2024 8:43 am\nHi Terence,\nI started to answer this, but it got long, So I\u2019m writing a tip that may help. Look for it in the next day or so.\nJohn Harries\nAuthor\nReply\nTerence Thatcher\nJune 14, 2024 7:46 am\nHi Terence,\nJust published some thoughts that may help:\nhttps://www.morganscloud.com/jhhtips/howe-to-increasing-the-insured-value-of-our-boat/\nLoad Rest of Comments\nJoin The Conversation\nContact\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy\nComment Tips\nRecent Comments\nConsulting\nBluesky\nFind Us On Facebook\nRSS Feed\n\u00a9 Attainable Adventure Cruising Ltd and the authors, all rights are reserved.\nNothing on this website or in direct communications received from us, or in our articles in the media, should be construed to mean or imply that offshore voyaging is anything other than potentially hazardous.

Whether you own a bass fishing boat or a yacht, it\u2019s important to find the right boat insurance that will come to the rescue if you have damage or theft. Here\u2019s how to understand boat insurance policies.\nDo you need boat insurance?\nYour\nhome insurance\npolicy covers your boat in some cases, but it doesn\u2019t go far. Homeowners policies typically cap boat coverage at $1,000 or 10% of your home\u2019s insured value. And liability coverage \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 typically isn\u2019t included under home insurance. So a home insurance policy might help you only if your boat is small, slow and inexpensive.\nAt a glance: Do I need boat insurance?\nYes\nNo\nYachts.\nLarge sailboats.\nJet boats.\nPersonal watercraft like WaveRunners.\nAnything that runs faster than 25 mph.\nCanoes.\nBoats with small engines.\nAny other small, slow, inexpensive boat.\nWhat boat insurance will pay for\nYou can typically buy liability insurance \u2014 which pays for damage your boat does to others \u2014 in amounts from $15,000 to $300,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Here's what else you can expect from a policy:\nWhat boat insurance typically covers\nWhat it doesn\u2019t cover\nDamage or destruction from a collision, fire, lightning, theft and vandalism.\nDamage to a boat and permanently attached equipment, such as anchors.\nBodily injury liability, which pays expenses when someone is injured on your boat.\nProperty damage liability, which pays for damage your boat causes to someone else\u2019s property.\nGuest passenger liability, which pays for legal expenses of someone driving your boat with permission.\nMedical payments, which pay expenses for you and your passengers.\nNormal wear and tear.\nDefective machinery or machinery damage.\nDamage from sharks and other creatures.\nDamage from mold, insects and zebra mussels.\nCheck, too, about additional coverage for trailers and accessories, for towing and for damage caused by an uninsured boater.\nYou can buy two types of damage coverage for a boat:\nActual cash value.\nThis pays the value of your boat at the time of the damage. If your boat is destroyed, your insurance company determines its market value.\nAgreed amount value.\nIf your boat is destroyed, your insurer pays you an amount that you and the company agreed on beforehand. If your boat can be repaired, your insurer replaces old items for new ones without deducting for depreciation.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what your boat insurance covers before heading out on the water, says Todd Shasha, boat and yacht personal insurance director at Travelers Insurance. He recommends checking whether your policy can cover these scenarios:\nMechanical breakdown coverage.\nPays to repair or replace your outboard motor as long as it\u2019s not due to wear and tear.\nSalvage.\nIf your boat becomes disabled and a basic tow won\u2019t help, you might need to call a salvage company to recover it. Typically a salvage company will ask for a percentage of the boat\u2019s value as payment, which can be quite expensive. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage.\nGadgets.\nNot all boat insurers cover expensive accessories like fishing equipment or fancy coolers unless they\u2019re permanently attached to the boat. For example, Travelers offers personal property coverage that pays you if they\u2019re stolen or lost while out on the water. Endorsements, which are additions to your policy, are available if you want to increase the value of your personal property limits.\nSome important things to know about boating and your policy:\nNavigational limits:\nIf you own a yacht or a larger boat, your policy will have limits outlining where you can navigate your vessel. If you venture outside of the territory you agreed to in the policy, your insurance may not cover you. Typically, the broader your navigation area is, the higher your insurance costs will be.\nLayup periods:\nTaking your boat out of the water is typical during cold weather, and most insurance companies will give you a credit because it\u2019s not being used. But take the boat out for a spin before the layup period ends and you won\u2019t be covered by your insurance policy.\nMarine inspections:\nIf your boat is an older model, most insurance companies will want you to have it inspected by a marine surveyor in order to assess the vessel\u2019s condition and market value. For safety\u2019s sake, consider a marine survey even if it\u2019s not required.\nUnderage operators:\nYou might be tempted to let your 12-year-old drive the boat every now and then. But if your child doesn't meet age and license requirements in your state, your boat insurance policy might not cover you.  Age and license requirements for operating personal watercraft vary from state to state. In Virginia and Florida, for example, no one under 14 may operate a personal watercraft. In Texas, children under 13 are barred from driving one unless a licensed operator who's at least 18 is on board. For requirements where you live, check with the boating regulatory agency in your state.\nBoat insurance costs and discounts\nHow much you\u2019ll pay for boat insurance depends on the level of insurance coverage you want, as well as the size, horsepower, type and value of your boat.\nYou can choose your deductible, which is the amount deducted from your insurance check if you make a claim. A typical policy has deductibles of $250 for property damage, $500 for theft and $1,000 for medical payments, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Liability claims against you do not have a deductible.\nInsurance companies offer a variety of ways to save money, including discounts for:\nHaving a diesel-powered boat.\nNot having made a previous boat insurance claim.\nCarrying other policies, such as car or homeowners, with the same insurer.\nTaking safety courses.\nWhere to buy boat insurance\nBoat insurance is widely available. NerdWallet looked at the top 25 auto insurance sellers in the country and found these that also offer boat insurance:\nAAA\nOffers coverage for boats up to $250,000 in value.\nAAA lowers your deductible by 25% each time you renew your policy and haven\u2019t had a claim.\nAllstate\nAverage cost of boat insurance from Allstate is about $20 a month, according to Allstate.\nBundle boat insurance with an Allstate homeowners policy and you qualify for up to a 20% discount.\nAmerican Family Insurance\nAdditional coverage options cover personal items and pay for repairs to your boat and equipment, without a deduction for depreciation.\nAmica\nIf your boat is disabled, an Amica policy covers towing to nearest port.\nIf your yacht can\u2019t be repaired, Amica pays to replace it with a new one, without subtracting depreciation.\nAuto-Owners\nOptional boat insurance coverage is available through homeowners policies.\nCountry Financial\nCountry Financial homeowners insurance covers your boat for up to $1,500.\nYou can buy more coverage under your homeowners policy.\nErie\nErie\u2019s standard Boat Protector Policy comes with extras, including payments up to $500 to fix or replace boating equipment and accessories, and payments up to $250 for emergency towing. (Not available in Kentucky.)\nFarmers\nFarmers offers seven packages to fit your vessel type and coverage needs.\nGeico\nGeico\u2019s optional premium boat towing service offers unlimited on-water towing (within 25 miles of an approved tower) and pays the service provider directly.\nGeico offers several discounts, including one for passing a boat-safety course and for maintaining a good driving record.\nHanover\nYou can cover your boat, sailboat or personal watercraft with an endorsement to your Hanover Platinum or Connections homeowners insurance policy.\nThe Hartford\nAdditional coverage, which costs extra, is available for your accessories, trailer and boat hull.\nLiberty Mutual\nYou must have a homeowners insurance policy with Liberty Mutual to get boat and watercraft insurance.\nMetLife\nOptional coverage includes hurricane protection, which pays up to $250 to move your boat out of danger during a hurricane advisory.\nUnforeseen emergency services coverage pays $250 for towing and other services on land or in the water.\nNationwide\nPersonal watercraft coverage includes liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured or underinsured operator, and medical payments.\nOptional towing and labor also available.\nProgressive\nTotal loss replacement coverage pays for a new boat if your new boat is a total loss within five years of adding the coverage.\nProgressive offers several specialized coverage options, including 24-hour roadside assistance if your car breaks down while towing your boat.\nUnlike some insurers, Progressive doesn\u2019t require you to submit a navigation plan. Nor does it require an inspection of your boat.\nState Farm\nState Farm\u2019s optional emergency service pays up to $500 to service your boat, motor or boat trailer.\nOptional wreck-removal coverage pays \u201creasonable expenses\u201d to raise or remove your boat when it\u2019s required by law.\nTravelers\nTravelers splits the cost to move the vessel to safety when you carry \u201churricane-escape reimbursement\u201d coverage, which costs extra.\nAntique boats get the same comprehensive coverage available in Travelers' basic policy.\nUSAA\nUSAA members get a 5% discount on boat insurance, but the discount is not available in all states.\nUSAA is open only to active and retired military and their families.\nJuan Castillo is a former staff writer at NerdWallet.\nAbout the author\nJuan Castillo\nHelpful resources\nThe 5 Best Car Insurance Companies of January 2026\n6 Best Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nCheap Car Insurance\n5 Best Term Life Insurance Companies in January 2026\nMore like this\nInsurance\nCompare Car Insurance Rates\nCompare car insurance quotes online for free to find your best rate.
